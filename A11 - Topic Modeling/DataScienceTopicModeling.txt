Wawa, on
Yea these internet plans are amazing in comparison wtf. Would I be able to keep using it in Ontario (data too) no problem, even if I move back?
Cool thanks for the pointers. Shediac would be cool to end up if I can make a run at being a greasy land lord
Yes sorry corrected that! That is our net income
Calgary has lot of jobs for someone with high school diploma. Problem with Calgary is there is too many over qualified people.
Thank you kindly. You find Dieppe is tough for non french speakers? My gf is Filipino.
If there is no employer matching you do NOT need to go through RBC.  You’re contributing $500 per pay, so you can contribute $0 per pay and have $500 per pay (the day after) go into whatever account you want.

Using RBC here makes no sense.

The alternative is to put $500 into the RBC rrsp and then every so often move that money somewhere else - but doesn’t sound like you need RBC here.
EQ bank HISA
LOL thanks man
Ok thank you for the input. What you think I can rent a main house for in riverview? And live in the suite..
Not cheaper in Vancouver. Developers price in the projected Price appreciation. 
If property value drops you're responsible for the mortgage shortfall
Do you mean your net income a month is $9564 as opposed to gross? If it’s only gross than that’s not much left over after house payments.
RSMCs don't have to do a lot of walking.
Southern NB is extremely affordable and relatively underrated by locals. You can still make a decent living out here doing basic jobs like retail/call-centre/serving/etc. Lots of young entrepreneurs and solid career paths too if you are willing to put in the work.

It's not perfect by any means, but with rents as low as $600 utilities included, and a job market that is desperate for motivated employees, it can be a pretty great place to be. A lot of locals complain about there being no jobs, but in my experience it's more that there are no jobs they want to do and a lot of jobs that don't want to hire them. There's also a strong vocal minority of complainers on local social medias. I have a lot of local friends who complain about the job market, but then turn around and stop going to their new job because they are bored and would prefer to watch Netflix...

If you're a driven individual, you can make a decent life out here. For example, one of my buddies has a bomb career in insurance. He got into it with only a high-school diploma and some basic computer skills. It's a job many people don't even know exists. There's also a lot of good call-center work out here. If you can save up to go to university/college, there's also a lot of good work in IT here too. It's not the most prestigious work or the most prestigious part of the country, but you can make a pretty sweet life out here on a reasonable income.

In terms of the "not perfect by any means", some fair warnings. Our population is tiny compared to Ontario so the job market is also tiny. Things move slow and there isn't as much selection as other places. That doesn't mean there isn't jobs, it's just that our job market is sizes relative to our tiny province. Most people advise finding a job before moving here or be willing to take an in-between job while you search for work. Our local governments are also basically a write-off. Irving and other major corporations basically fund the two main provincial parties so they get away with anything. We flip flop between them and get nowhere on fixing real issues. Money gets burnt every time we flip-flop. All our media outlets are also owned by Irving. You may end up working for them too because they employ a lot of the province. Our population is also aging because most young successful people bail and move away to larger salaries and more prestigious communities. We also get a lot of moving out to retire here and take advantage of the low cost of living. This means more tax for working people here. 15% sales tax, laughably high property tax, high income tax. We also have a sever lack of family doctors because the province has an outdated and corrupt policy on practices. Every 4 years all 4 parties promise to fix it, and then they never do. It's finally getting better as old doctors retire freeing up practicing licenses, but we're still in a huge hole with a years long wait-list. Expect to not have a family doctor for like half a decade. Oh, also every government is broke out here, despite the high taxes and massively profitable industries. Municipalities try their best, but industry pollution, the rich moving beyond city limits to dodge taxes, and brutal Winter damage really impact things. The industries get massive tax cuts and the working population is too small to support the infrastructure repairs and medical needs of the old population. It's dodgey, but somehow things keep trucking along for decades in this state. As an individual, it doesn't impact you too much, but it's worth being aware of before settling down here.

Oh and don't buy/rent near rivers. They've been flooding a lot lately.

Noted. Thanks!
If you believe the great depression is about to happen again - you know something we all don't. Your risk profile should be zero and you should certainly be using a savings account/gics.
Got it thanks! New words to learn...
If you're exploring a roboadvisor, I'd also take a good look at asset allocation ETFs like VGRO/VBAL or XGRO/XBAL. The fees are half what Investease charges and in the case of XGRO, It's going to be made up of exactly the same ETFs that the Investease growth portfolio uses. I'm going to echo what was said above and consider contributing to a TFSA on your own- if you're early in your career and your employer isn't matching you, I don't see the point of using your RRSP room right now. Sounds like your employer is "offering" to just get kickbacks from RBC in exchange for a withdrawal scheme you could set up yourself in your chequing account on payday.
Yeah no problem. Rent fluctuates a lot (to be fair) but it goes up and down based off the oil patch. I moved here in 2016 and rent was cheap but the oilpatch picked up a bit in 2018 and I noticed all my co workers(and mine) rent went up like 30%, mine went up to 1300 from 990 a month for a condo in a decent part of town and 2 parking spots. My partner and I purchased a house last June though for 245000$ when the same house with the same amount of land in Kitchener would have been well over 650,000$. Property tax is also 1/2 what it is in Kitchener/Cambridge and from what I can see the service is much better (despite the memes about potholes, the city can't control that). Maybe even less (and GP has the highest property taxes in Alberta including major cities). All this doesn't even take into account the increased pay due to working in GP and the northern living bonus/allowance. GP is perfect for me I can't even think of an amenity that I don't have access to, nightlife is lacking but I'm pretty settled at this point and don't care about that sort of thing personally but some people prefer that, and I understand. Utilities are generally cheaper but not noticbly cheaper (again anecdotale but worth mentioning).
So you are ok with having half your after tax income going to mortgage and property tax? Normally it's in the 30-35% range. Do you have an emergency fund that covers 6 months of expenses? Do you have any debts?
It’s like a convenience store
I mean you wanted a way to cheapen your car loan and the best option for that is selling that vehicle and buying a cheaper one that isn’t costing you $1100 a month. If not and you can afford it just keep paying it. You sound like have a lot of other shit so sell some of that and use it to pay off the loan?
Let's hope he proves you wrong. I for one don't look forward to Canada's economic powerhouse to "sink" anytime soon.
I live 10 min walk west of downtown and work downtown, what are you poutine recommendations?
If he has joint problems, being a letter carrier is not a good idea. Also you work as a temp for years (I work there)
Don't drive thankfully, what's a depaneur? On mobile but Google results didn't explain much lol
Bahaha. Kenney is gonna sink that province
First the realtor. Once you accept an offer then you find a notary.   Your realtor will explain the process.
Ok, good to know.
Up 18%. Quoted with a another insurer, basically same price.
What kind of tips are you looking for?

Get a cell phone plan here, we have better deals than Ontario. I usually recommend Koodo or Fido. For Internet, go with Ebox.

Download the Transit app.

Summer festival is upon us. There's gonna be lots of free stuff to do. Jazz fest, Francofolies, Just for laughs, Zoofest, Mural, Picnik Electronic, Premiers vendredis. Take a look at Sorstu.ca, CultMtl.com and Nightlife.ca for event listings.
Interesting, can confirm your being paid consistent with your counterparts
Go to Schwartz.
I wonder if this would qualify as 'bills' for some cash back cards.
Rcmp. If you actually get in, you pretty much dont have to worry about anything. Remote work location very likely after graduation.
You can leave it as is. Or you can cash it out, but there's a 30% withholding so leave it till you retire or really need the money.
High Rise electrical
Perfect. You can leave those as is and not cause yourself any grief.
RRSP you say we're fine, cashing out or leaving it?
Exactly. I hate to admit it, but the second housing is affordable in Toronto I’ll move there. And there’s a lot out there just like me. All of us is kind of preventing the housing from becoming affordable in the first place. Demand is just so much higher than the supply and I don’t see that changing any time soon.
if you don't plan to eat into your principal you might want to double check the math yourself
I would suggest picking something you would be interested in making, like a game, website, phone app, etc.. Look at the table found here to see which language works best for that task: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq#wiki_which_programming_language_should_i_start_with.3F.
Then work towards making whatever interests you while learning the language. That link has a variety of info about getting started.

I grew up in Ontario. Had no idea the other provinces hated us so much (I think it's mostly in jest ... maybe) till I moved out west. "Onterrible" is surprisingly common.
The language, the culture, and different government services. Honestly it’s cheaper living but working in Ottawa and living in Gatineau can be a bit annoying
Whether you get a condo or not will depend on a billion things beyond your income.  

Check the market when you are thinking of buying — if the market sucks you will lose.
Calgary is also just a sweet ass town. I've never lived there. Stayed for about a week or so during a cross country trip in 2012 and liked it so much I was ready to stay. Kept going cuz I wanted to say hello to the rockies but I'd move there in a heartbeat.
That’s what I have been told by my financial advisor.   My portfolio is growing and I am still putting in about 15 grand a year.   I am hoping when I actually start drawing I will be in the range I need.
Thanks, I really appreciate your inputs.
We don't have a TFSA. We both have RRSP and pension plans with our jobs.
Over the last 5 years, if the OPs investment lost money, during a period of MASSIVE gains, at least in equities, then they should run.

Now, if they bought into a bond mutual fund as a way of mitigating risk.....well, what a risky decision that was....
OK, France doesn't recognize a TFSA. So if you have one, your options are to keep it (and pay high taxes on dividends and capital gains) or liquidate it and take the money with you and invest in France.

Your RRSP is fine.
I'm living in Edmonton, Alberta. You could find a place near the University here pretty easily. Like in Mckernan/Belgravia area. 

Especially Mckernan/Belgravia (I don't know the difference actually), because the LRT is right there on 111 st, as well as being within walking distance of the University. 

I'm not sure if the cost of living is lower than it is in Ontario here, but $600 for a room in a shared house is usual. You could find cheaper, but they're *cheaper*. 

You can easily spend ~$200 a month on groceries. 

Cheapest network in the area is Freedom mobile, I pay $40 for pretty much unlimited data (it's throttled after a certain point).

I pay $30 for 2mb/s dl from TekSavvy.

You would want to move closer to the places you'll be all the time because transit isn't the greatest in this city. A mixture of poor planning and ridership not being quite enough to necessitate more service.

Also 5% tax, lowest tax anywhere I think. 

If you've never owned a car before, I think you'd be seen as a new driver by insurance companies so be prepared to pay ~$200 a month for insurance if you decide to get a car.
Looks at the federal government job site and apply to jobs that you find interesting and qualified for. Move to where ever those jobs are.
About your edit, you're right, leaving in 2019 is probably easier.
Very true.
Thank you this is good advice!
Montreal by far. You don’t know what you’re missing.
>Soon, I will have a wife joining me, will maybe have to go to school or look for a job.

You have to pick one. If you go to school, you reduction of income will prevent you from buying or renting.
Exactly! Moving to France.
Not really. I mean for example I'm from the Kitchener area  and penny for penny Costco is the same price as kitchener but since Alberta only pays the 5% GST instead of 13% hst most things come cheaper (groceries aren't taxed in either province but you get the idea). Some things do cost more such as mechanic time. I use to pay 80$ for a shop hour at a good shop in Cambridge Ontario bit the standard rate is 125-150 for grande prairie. Other services are similar such as plumbing and electricity. Gas is cheaper than in Ontario but I can't confirm of that's anecdotal or not. My commute is much shorter so my overall gas expense is less than 1/4 what it use to be (my current commute is 5km each way vs 45 I'm each way going from rural Cambridge to Kitchener). My quality of life has drastically improved as well due to my new income being 3x what it use to be and my CoL being 80% what it use to be. I moved on 2016 so I would imagine the CoL in grande prairie is even lower compared to Cambridge/Kitchener area than it use to be so I woulld guess it's 70% ish compared to 80% when o moved here.
Oh, you are renting from the buyers...ah ok, I thought they were going to rent from you.

Ok, then it's even simpler lol

Which country are you moving to?
I kinda disagree. Saskatchewan (particularly Saskatoon) is the perfect place to be. Reasons:

1) Graduate retention program enables OP to receive up to $20,000 in tax credits if the works in SK after graduating. Also, that home buyers credit for first time home buyers (I think it was 20,000$)
2) cheaper car insurance and cell phone plans 
3) easy access to Calgary and Edmonton (5-6 hours drive away from Saskatoon) and they have *some* opportunities too (yea, I know the economy sucks there right now but it doesn’t change the fact they are one of the biggest cities after TOR/VAN in Canada)
4) Smaller population in SK, so less crowds to deal with. (I personally not a fan of large populated areas)

I can’t think of anything else right now but there are a lot more.
Learn/practice as much french as you can. Although Montreal has a large english speaking population, there are many areas where people barely speak conversational english, including hospitals and government services. Much of road signage is also only in french. West=Ouest and East=Est. Don't see Est on road signs and think this "oh this road was established in 66, NO the sign means that Est. 66 is Exit 66 EAST." 

&#x200B;

I do not know where you will live and where your work is but if you live off the island and drive in using a bridge, there is crazy traffic and roadwork being done all the time all year long. We're erecting a new bridge to replace Champlain Bridge(the biggest bridge connecting to Montreal) so if you're anywhere near there driving, it can be ultra confusing.

&#x200B;

Don't pay extra for poutine at major fast food chains like McDonalds, Harveys etc. It always sucks.
This is why you don’t vote liberal or NDP.
Not nearly as bad as people think. I find food is pretty average, not as cheap as ontario (at least that's what I'm told) but it's cheaper than NL. Gas is like 1.25/L. My car insurance is around $850 a year. 

It's also a lot easier to find work as long as you're not the millionth person to come out of University with a computer related degree. Tech is probably the only truly lacking sector here.
it's a matter of perspective. He's incredibly flexible in what he wants, he isn't bound to education or industry, you can do a lot out there if you're open-minded.
Hi there. Quick question about your appeal. Did you just submit the letter and they reassesed your claim or did you submit a formal appeal? I just submitted a letter a week ago and am just curious if I should submit a formal appeal if this doesn't go anywhere. Thanks
We won't rent it before selling it actually. We'll sell it in 2 weeks and then we'll pay a rent until our departure in December or January.
Thanks! I think I’m going to try ask some of the additional doctors for medical documentation to add to my family doctors. And then contact an accountant. I’m a bit worried that I fall in the crack, where I’m too disabled to function normally and need a lot of help, but I’m not disabled enough to be “disabled” in regards to qualifying for things. Financially it would make such a difference to get the tax credit.
Oh. 

*Woosh*

So anyways, how is Nova Scotia? I'm researching what are the best LCOL cities in the country that I can baristaFIRE
Extremely few people understand the commitment they are making when picking a degree, whether you give them money or not.

For the record, you don't have to give them their RESP, you just have to repay the government grants and you can roll it into your RRSP if you have room. It's kind of crazy not maxing it out if you have the means, figure out what you want to do with it later.
What about food, gas, etc is it more expensive than Edmonton or Calgary? Would you know
Reddit in general is very unfriendly towards conservatives

Reminds me of Twitter and Google/YouTube
Probably not a proper Toronto/Vancouver condo like you're thinking. Probably a building from the 60s or 70s that was a residential apartment building until recently and then the owner decided to sell off units. It's much cheaper too if you buy a unit in a building that is only 3-4 stories because it will be wood frame instead of steel and concrete. Elevators are optional too when the building is so short.
Different in what way?
Congratulations. None of that makes up for the fact that you made an idiotic vehicle purchase (or maybe several based on your reply). Your post makes absolutely no sense. You're asking about a better way to pay off your vehicle loan. A) sell the vehicle and pay it off. B) use the pile of liquid cash that you're bragging about to pay it off. Or C), sell some of your toys (RV?) and use that money in combination with cash to pay off the loan. 

You're really asking for financial advice because you're struggling to makes ends meet and also bragging about your wealth in the same thread? Huh.
I'd never buy a pre-construction. Without being able to physically enter the space, I'm not convinced I'd get what I'm paying for. Too much risk for not enough upside.
The job market in Calgary is flush???? It's not....
You would pay tax on the gain from the point of you renting it out to selling it. But since it's for a short time, you can elect to keep as primary residence: [https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/personal-income/line-127-capital-gains/principal-residence-other-real-estate/changes-use/changing-your-principal-residence-a-rental-business-property.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/personal-income/line-127-capital-gains/principal-residence-other-real-estate/changes-use/changing-your-principal-residence-a-rental-business-property.html)

But you still have to claim the rental income, just don't CCA it.

EDIT ADDITION: I highly recommend moving before January 2020. Less paperwork on your end. So when you do your 2019 tax return, you do all the usual and you list the date you left Canada as Dec XX, 2019. You'll have your employment income and rental income on your tax return. Don't forget to suspend your provincial health insurance and river's license and you'll be good for being a non-resident.

Depending on what country you go to , you may have issue regarding any investments in Canada.
But isn't basic everyday staples much more expensive? And the job market I heard is bad?
> Co versely, if the government owes you hundreds (or thousands) they do not pay interest.

I'll just clarify that if a taxpayer files their return on time  the CRA will pay compound daily interest on the amount that it owes the tax payer.  See [this page.](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/refunds.html#dgtntrstnrrfnd)
Windsor still has the cheapest rent and I believe real estate in canada
Onterrible...

I'm totally stealing that one
Only coro tax paid at the high rate can be paid to shareholder as eligible.

I had no parents and no help when I started my degree. I graduated with 24k in student loans and a lot of missed opportunities.

From my perspective, the real benefit of funding a kid's education is the ability for that person to get by without needing to work a full time job while worrying about exams, labs, etc. The value of the grades far exceeds what a student can earn, so I see it as a double-benefit.

That being said, I don't know how much tuition will increase between now and when my kids start school so I'm putting away a little bit each year with the expectation that if they need the money, I can provide a little nudge in the right direction. I am 100% not expecting to fully fund our children's education, a little debt and some expectation of contribution from a child is a good idea.

Now from a cynical legal perspective, if you think there's a chance you might get divorced or separated, know that you are probably on the hook to pay for your children's education anyways (in Alberta for sure, not sure about other provinces) so the money you're socking away now could help alleviate some burdens that you might face down the road anyways.

For more information on that aspect, see Achkewich v Achkewich 1998 ABQB 280, specifically paragraph 4: "It is clear, as the cases in general state, that the question of parental support for children of divorced parents for post secondary education should be decided on a case by case basis. However, in my view, as we approach the millennium, the presumption of parental support for a first degree of up to 4 years should apply, absent other contrary  considerations."

***********Bear in mind that I'm not a lawyer and even if I was, you shouldn't take advice from a stranger on the internet, nor am I even giving you legal advice, I am simply highlighting legal information that is publicly available and if you are in doubt as to whether you would owe child support for your children's education you should consult a family law lawyer.**********
It was a (ill-conceived) joke
I am living proof that you are quite wrong.  Let's do a break down.

Mortgage: $550/month

Condo Fees: $275

Cash flow - $200/month.
Wow I had no idea it was province specific! I am in AB, my first audit they received adjusted my claim because I had included my RMT appts and said they weren’t valid. Even with my health benefits I can’t claim massage therapy with my health savings account. Unfortunately with our new government I don’t anticipate it changing anytime soon.
On any of your recent returns did you indicate the your date of permanent residency as a date of immigration?  From what I understand the information the CRA has is rooted in the Immigration/Emigration dates.  When these dates don't line up their system can't tell what is what when it comes to valid contribution room.

This could especially happen if the return you filed in 2014 didn't indicate it was a newcomer return with an immigration date.
Emergency fund can be in a lot of places, but it can *never* be in stocks.

Line of credit..... two words "opportunity cost"
East coast baby, aside from the lower cost of living, everybody's just more chill out here!
While I agree it’s unlikely I just think it’s bold to say never. None of us can predict the future. Do we think the US is stable and won’t cause issues in the future? Do we believe no wars will cause issues it in the future? Not sure.
Windsor
Somewhat unrelated, but you could Take a tesol course and teach english abroad. I met people in indonesia making 1600 euro a month for teaching part time and living costs were like 160 to 200. Mad savings and great cultural experiences
Why is it insane ?

Not worth it.... :)
Lol I got 250k in my house, own a second vehicle, a recreation vehicle, 50k in the bank and RRSPs 

Just looking for a better strategy to pay it off and not have to dip into savings in the winter when I’m off..  

Thanks for the “advice”
What you really need to do is work out what your financial goals are. If retiring early is something that you're looking into - you might want to check out the FIRE movement.
So would you say Calgary is the better option than Windsor? I'm considering both and am looking for basic minimum wage jobs, not sure which place would be better for that, plus rent and transit.
Oil only hit the price it did in the 00s because of the Iraq war.  The US learned from that and upped their oil production to the point they're the biggest producer in the world right now, everyone worldwide dumped billions into renewable energy, and Venezuela's economy collapsed.  Oil will never come even close to those prices again.
Most people in Shediac speak English, I have family there and I’ve been going to visit my entire life, never came across someone who wasn’t bilingual.

It is fairly far from the city and a bit “middle of nowhere” though. It’s an adorable place but some people could find it boring.
How could I start learning these basics? Is there a non-gimmicky website that actually shows you realistic basic programming?

I go to Mobil one at the superstores. You get 3.5c vs 1c at the esso.

Our co also uses esso for our fleet cards. Yes I still get points at the gas stations.
New Brunswick. It's pretty cheap to live here.
Even if the interest *were* taxed in India, you would still need to pay tax on it in Canada, less the amount of Indian tax already paid. If there is no Indian tax, then it's fully taxable in Canada.
> They might seal my tire twice every time

Time is money, my friend. And safety... it'll be too late if that one time they didn't seal it properly and it caused you a blowout going 100km/h on the highway.  
  
You do NOT want to jimp on things like tires.
- Get a Bixi pass for the season, $80 for all your travel during good weather months. 
- Participate in Grand Prix and Mural Fest, big events that cost little. 
- if you drive, learn to read street parking signs, tickets are such a pain. 
- make friends with the owner of the nearest depaneur. 
- Gas up before you get into Montréal, gas tax is $0.15 more on the island than anywhere else.
Would you say London is better than Windsor in terms of available jobs vs rent costs and reliable transit ?
Jesus, can I work for him. That's good money. Pm me, seriously.
Yeah these payment options have been discussed. The catch is the 2.5% fee they charge.
Yeah I wouldn't do it. Besides Montreal is beautiful. Even a room for rent is $700 now. Was $450 just a couple years ago.
[Canada Post](https://ca.indeed.com/cmp/Canada-Post?from=femp&attributionid=femp) has opportunities all over the country.
Ah, I definitely missed that sentence. My bad.
Let's not forget Windsor, very affordable. Also very warm in Windsor, though the job market is tough atm.
The joint account is why we chose them too. Good note about the debit card! We will get a chequing account too.
If TFSA is maxed then time to start RRSP. RRSP is almost always a good idea, this is more a comment towards maximum optimization. Maybe put 6000 in a HISA to move to your TFSA next year if you want.
I'm thinking of moving to Ottawa from Montreal, but yeah it's expensive even with the higher minimum wage. Plus I saw an article about AirBnb fucking the market there, and not as many apartments to begin with.
That's why you should always track your own contributions and withdrawals and not follow what CRA has on their site.

Your contribution starts in the year that you are over 18, legal resident of Canada and a valid SIN.

TFSA doesn't reset, there is additional space every Jan 1. For 2019, the contribution number was $6000.
Hit up Cornwall or Windsor and work your way up a restaurant chain
Also beware of currency fluctuation devaluing the return ... Or possibly increasing it
All law enforcement is short staffed and hiring currently. So if you are interested in that at all OP , LE jobs generally provide good pay and rock steady guaranteed jobs.

CSC would be an ... interesting experience. Takes a special kind of person to work long term in close proximity to those types of individuals and in such a militant unionized environment.
HELOCs exist for this reason. Many people do.
Yeah it's still like that.. for example I work at AHS and I get 2000$ northern bonus even tho I make penny for penny same as Calgary or Edmonton. My co workers 14 year old daughter makes 17$ an hour at the clairmont A & W which is more than I made as a supervisor at a metal work shop in southern Ontario.... I find there's a lot to do here for my own hobbies such as the local ski hill (nitehawk) is better than the best ski hill in southern Ontario (blue mountain) and it's less than 10 mins away, cheaper, and less busy. If you are even a bit out doorsy there is lots to do here to keep busy.
What about Windsor, very affordable rent. Finding work, that's a different story.
Doesn't sound like this guy is one of the fittest types around to be handling convicted criminals considering he already has bad joints and a pinched nerve in his mid 20's. 

Definitely takes a special person though, I know I will guy I work with and he's a little bit.... special.
Apparently this finance sub is plagued by the same downfalls as /r/Canada and /r/Ontario.
GP is a good spot. If driving is an option (which really almost is necessary with their transit) living in Clairmont, or Beaverlodge is a good way to keep costs down on rent as well.

Most into retail/fast food places will hire above minimum wage, there is the Northern Living tax exemption which usually gets you around $1000/yr back on taxes, and some companies will even pay Northern Living Allowance on top of it ($2/hr on top of wage.)

When I lived there I worked in the mall and was making $15/hr when the minimum was around $12. Even Tim's was hiring at $15 at the time. there isn't a ton of recreational stuff to do there, but if it's a work > home and just save money thing, it's a good place to start.
They speak French there.
You are using the leverage of the mortgage to invest in stocks.  Leverage kills, especially newbies.       
Keep a healthy emergency fund and make sure your income will handle the mortgage comfortably.... but otherwise put all the rest into the home downpayment until you have about 50% equity.
Shipyard job?
Still sounds better than losing a rat race over on the West coast.
I beg to differ. Everyone cares about his money more than him if he's willing to give it away.
For the foreign country on the T5, you could look and see what stocks are included in the ETFs you hold, and select whichever it, or just select Multiple since it will be good enough.


For the OEPTC, it is part of the Ontario Trillium Benefit. There is no harm is filling it in, as it is not factored into the refund/balance owing. So if you end up not qualifying for it, they just won't issue you the benefit.
I think paying at Esso pumps count as Esso and get the gas designation. Paying inside Circle k may not.
Oh its a hub yes, but its a big step down from Vancouver in terms of cleanliness and appearance. Plus you have to deal with people from Dieppe hon hon.
As per [https://tradingeconomics.com/india/inflation-cpi](https://tradingeconomics.com/india/inflation-cpi) about 2.86%.
Tangerine, 1.2%. And now realizing I need to make a switch to something else.
yup
Dunno why you're getting down voted to oblivion but you're right. I work in construction and most of the builders I work with are very optimistic with the industry moving forwaThe title is not a concern except for those with inflated egos.

The concern about data science and people being employed as such is that the title is strongly correlated with an outsized salary. It feels unfair that people who spend effort learning the ins, outs, advantages, and pitfalls of statistical reasoning in order to do good, high-quality work are coming up short against people whose only experience with statistics is a 3-month bootcamp focused on a high-level neural network API just because the interview process is based on rote memorization of buzzwordy gotchas.
During the job hunt, there's no time to be reading the job description. In the span of reading one job description I could have applied to 10 jobs.

Once I get interviews, I immediately judge on whether to proceed based on the coding challenge or the interview questions.

It would be a lot simpler if they detailed the job titles such as Data Scientist, Product / Analytics. I appreciate those labels since it indicates to me to avoid like the plague.
So, ill just say this about the Rand program. Very prestigious think tank, hear it’s a good place to work for. But I have never come across a single professional in the field, doing research that didn’t have a degree from a more mainstream university or program.

Since I am based in Houston, I saw a lot of former Oil and Gas quantitative types that went and did a bootcamp to transition into data science. I think that was a great target group for a bootcamp - these were normally people who had a grad degree in engineering, math or physics, 3-5 years of experience doing mathematical modeling of some type or another, but didn't have experience a) specifically in machine learning, or b) using Python.

With that type of educational foundation, 12 week was PLENTY of time to learn how to use a handful of machine learning algorithms and pick up Python to a really good level (because they normally had a lot of experience with other scripting languages, either Matlab/SAS, or more niche languages that I had never heard of).

I agree though - if you have an undergrad in humanities with no experience in math and/or programming, you won't get anywhere near the same value as someone who is 90% of the way there and just needs an extra bump.
Yeah - I don't really know. I just know that there are a lot of data scientists out there with very little understanding of the scientific method. Which I guess is fine. The whole meta meta meta thing we are doing here is only important if its preventing people from getting jobs they enjoy. As long as people are getting into whatever job that is doing whatever they want, Really shouldn't be complaining.

&#x200B;

Edit: I'm really trying to figure out what I would want my title to be, and  my job is probably closest to applied scientist or research engineer or something like that.
Here's the thing though: you should be able to get that from the job description without needing to talk to people. That, or that specific company needs to write better job descriptions.

Example: here are three different Data Scientist roles where I live (Houston):

Job 1:

* Perform data mining, cleansing, and manipulation; identify necessary data elements and their sources, leverage appropriate tools to acquire and consolidate large volumes of data from different sources, and identify and resolve any irrelevant, corrupt, missing, or incongruent data
* Identify and use appropriate analytic tools, technologies and platforms to execute analysis against business requirements, including the ability to scale, deploy and distribute models across enterprise as needed
* Support the development of performance management scorecards and dashboards to monitor adoption, implementation and impact of models and strategies
* Collaborate with cross-functional teams to frame requirements within an analytics context in order to tackle business goals

Job 2:

* Extracting value from data via statistical and machine learning methods and deploying these solutions into production
* Running data science training initiatives in customer organizations
* Communicating analysis to customer stakeholders
* Contributing to (Company) software products, directly and indirectly
* Developing machine learning enhanced data products

Job 3:

* Solving business problems using data driven analytical approaches including machine learning, statistics, modeling, and artificial intelligence.
* Implementing models in Microsoft Azure, AWS, Hana, and other systems, including open source data science tools.
* Building end-to-end solutions to solve high value business needs in a sustainable, innovative manner.
* Engaging in constant process improvement, always looking for opportunities to increase efficiency and reduce failures.
* Understanding the diverse business requirements and be able to translate those requirements into applicable solutions.
* Presenting and explaining technical information to diverse audiences.

Is it *at all* unclear from which job fits each type of data science role? You can literally just count how many of the job responsibilities are directly data science tasks to understand how "data science" heavy the role will be. 

Job 1 is a role where you will have a much broader set of responsibilities, not all of which are data science.

Job 2 is a consulting job, so while building models is half the job, the other half is keeping customers happy.

Job 3 just needs people to take business problems, turn them into data science problems and solve them. 

If you pair that with the actual company and what you know about them (Job 1 is a Fortune 100 company in an old-school industry, Job 2 is a smaller, niche consulting firm, Job 3 is an Oil and Gas mammoth), you can infer exactly what your job will be.

Again - if you want to have your own short-hand notation for what each role is called, that's fine. And it would be nice if all HR departments in the country got together and agreed on a consistent notation. But it doesn't change the fact that, at the end of the day, the truest representation of each job will be the full blown description and any job title structure, even if consistent, is going to be an approximation at best.

The Correctional Service of Canada is hiring (pretty short-staffed across the country). All you need is your high school diploma. They just started offering paid training (12 weeks) as well. Ontario region is fully staffed, but the Prairies are short-staffed and have a lower cost of living. Just one option for you, OP.

Have to disagree with you on that one
The leverage you get when buying into the market at a good time is powerful.  If you'd bought a 300k house with 5% down in 2010 and sold for 600k 5 years later, you walked away with huge windfall.  15k in 2010 in the S&P500 would have had stellar returns aswell, but not 300k.  Theres a ton of other externalities to this example but it's in my opinion the reason housing is SO coveted.  Will gains be that good ever again? shrug, no crystal ball.  

disclosure; I was a RE wuss and bought into ETF memes.
No, your example did not make sense.  It tries to compare       
(i) spending $1 to buy an asset , to     
(ii) spending $5 to buy the same asset.

It does not conclude anything about DRIPPING
We are contributing to our son’s RESP but we are prioritizing our retirement. We have only one child, and we think having aging parents without adequate savings is a bigger burden than having to pay some of his way through university. 


That being said, whenever we can we do put money in his RESP and hope to be able to have a decent chunk to help.
I’ll be the contrarian, and say your plan isn’t that bad an idea, so long as you know what you’re getting into. Hell, my wife and I are looking at something fairly similar, in the sense that we’re looking to buy a property now with the intention of living there in a number of years after retirement. Having a renter pay some of the purchase price down isn’t that bad an idea, given that we intend to purchase the property at some point.

We’ve also got experience as remote landlords on a different property, and we haven’t had any major issues in the past decade. I’d even go so far as to say our property manager goes a step above, and has provided excellent tenants over the years. That’s not to say it’s not without problems, but we did have a major flood in the past year and our property manager dealt with all the ground work, we did everything else remotely through our insurance company.

I’d say the big question would be if having no rental income would impact your overall retirement plan. We’re fortunate enough to be able to absorb any of the potential costs if we don’t have a renter, so that probably gives us a bit more risk tolerance here. If you’re single income and still have debt to pay down, I’d probably suggest caution though.
Isn't a TFSA just a tool? Could you not open a HISA inside a TFSA?
This. Credit cards are considered revolving credit while loans are installment credit. FICO scores and other scoring models (such as the Vantage Score used by Credit Karma, etc) consider a mix of these + auto loans, mortgage, etc to give you your overall credit score
One of the factors used in evaluating your credit score is the history of all the credit facilities you have. Along with...utilization, payment history, credit inquires. So having too much is not bad, so long as you are exceptional in managing it. It’s a  good idea to accept credit when it’s being offered as you never know when an emergency may arise. Best of of all if it is pre-approved you do not need go through the whole manual process of the application and you don’t need a credit bureau pulled I.e. pre-approved line of credit in this scenario. As mentioned in previous threads...if you do apply for a much larger facility such as a mortgage then yes the lender may ask you to close some facilities as this possesses credit risk exposure to the lender, risk that they prefer to reduce.
London Ontario
Thx!
Keep credit utilization under 30% and your good. Reduce credit card limits before applying for a big loan to be safe or on cards you no longer use.
I can confirm because I have it under my RBC RRSP 👍
I'm from out BC/AB living in onterrible right now, I would recommend Ottawa if you want to stay in the area, it's affordable and very very nice. Calgary is a beautiful city with a lot to offer and the cost of living is a LOT better than it was back in the early 2000s. You could get away with a decent place in a trendy neighborhood for about 60% of what you'd pay for in Toronto or the GTA, the job market is flush and there's a lot in the way of call centers. If you're looking for a lighter trade and have decent math skills I recommend communication technician. There's a bit of arm work involved here and there but nothing back breaking and it's a fulfilling job with good pay. Mount Royal university is a good school same with U of C but tuition there is expensive from what I hear. Best of Luck!
You will owe interest on the 300 and ot can be quite alot. Co versely, if the government owes you hundreds (or thousands) they do not pay interest. If you've been employed you should file yearly taxes. If you owe youll be in trouble. If they owe you, you're missing out
> I haven't had any income that the government doesn't know about. 

I'm not sure whether or not this protects you from the repeated failure to report penalty.  

On one hand there have been several people report to PFC that they were 8 or 9 years behind in their taxes and when they got caught up they didn't say anything about facing this penalty.  

But on the other hand last fall someone who didn't include their RESP EAP income on their income tax return 2 years in a row (because they didn't receive the T4As and they used autofill my return before the CRA received them) reported that they did face the repeatedly failure penalty.
If you want to settle in Ottawa, be prepared to learn French and get at least a university degree. 50% of the people here work for the government of Canada and the jobs are getting harder and more competitive because of the demand for bilingualism. People don’t want to invest in someone who is unilingual English. also price of homes / rent here is slowly starting to get expensive. 

I don’t know what to tell you about the other parts of the country but demands are different. I know just from hearing other people talk that trades are in demand and learning how to code (computer software) will always land you a high paying job

Edit: I should add that the other 50% in Ottawa work for big tech companies, start ups, or run their own restaurants.
Okay, that's really interesting, thanks!
A builder once told me he is much more careful and paranoid about ensuring everything is perfect in a new build if it hasn't been sold yet. He still cares about the pre sold ones but from the sounds of it, a lot less attention to detail is given to them.
The Esso near me is a Circle K now. Just changed over in the last couple weeks but they still sell Esso gas.
It's not only about what you have done, it's about what you might do.

If you have a massive amount of credit relative to your income, there's also a risk you'll use it and be unable to repay. Your good history and low utilization are precisely why you can even entertain getting more credit, but there is a limit.

It's not as if at $50,000 of credit there's a hard stop and you cannot get a dollar more. But each additional dollar, without additional income, is technically riskier than the last. Remember this is a continuum of risk and it will vary from lender to lender how much risk they are willing to tolerate, and and what rates, etc. This is their entire business.
Honestly, not even a bad thing.
I had a huge amount of "emergency cash" saved up. But then I realized i'm only making 2% on that, why not just pay off lump sums onto a higher percent debt.
Never say never. I will be following the AB market closely for the next 12 months.
There is zero indication more trade jobs will open up. The market is already insanely oversaturated here, and oil will never be back to where it used to be.
The word "family" means your wife and minor children, not your sister.
> I need to go through RBC ... I am confused whether I am able to set up my RRSP as an RBC investease account

This is a question you will have to ask your employer because though InvestEase is under the RBC umbrella they are separate.  

If not it may be possible to have your money land in an RBC RRSP mutual fund account and then have InvestEase transfer it into your RRSP InvestEase account.  I have helped someone do this recently and the mechanics is as easy as transferring money between bank accounts, but the transfers can take a week or 10 days.  And you would have to check to see if InvestEase would balk at doing small transfers as often as you would be contributing.
Looks pretty good. 

&#x200B;

A few comments - opportunity costs seem a little high. I would use 7%, but YMMV.

You should probably include in your mortgage the cost of LTT municipal and LTT provincial, as well as closing costs. These are substantial. There are also one time costs like lawnmowers, garbage cans, salt and shovels that don't really seem like much but really add up. 

Insurance seems low to me, but utilities seem high, so it's a wash?

Good luck!
Disadvantages  
\-It isn't built yet so you don't really know what you are buying into  
\-Delays can happen and the project can be underfunded so they can ask for more money if they need to  
\-You have to wait 3 or so years for the project to finish   


Advantages  
\-Cheaper than already built homes  
\-Your mortgage doesn't start until you move in so gives you time to save/be good with money
+1 on this. Used this last year
Calgary is a fairly affordable city right now, probably not the cheapest but having moved here from Ontario a couple of years ago I'm definitely saving alot on rent. Plus Calgary is awesome :)  My bf had a career change last year and started his glazing apprenticeship, he had no problem finding a new job. Good luck!
Pretty much! Vanguard created the fund to compete with all the roboadvisors that are showing up (Wealthsimple, Nest, etc you've probably seen the ads). Roboadvisors buy index funds for you and do all the rebalancing, you just need to contribute money. Vanguard decided to offer the same service with their own index funds and wrap it all up within a big "asset allocation" ETF that started trading last year. Blackrock, their biggest competitor, released similar products earlier this year because they were so popular. I think they're a great and easy start to investing for most people as long as you plan on holding them for many years - Larry Bates makes the same conclusion in Beat The Bank and the author of Millionaire Teacher is also a fan  [https://andrewhallam.com/2018/02/vanguard-canada-delivers-couch-potato-etfs/](https://andrewhallam.com/2018/02/vanguard-canada-delivers-couch-potato-etfs/) .
Do they sit around in their underware?
Oh I see, so I should be more so looking at what they're investing in rather than the past performance?
Wow, if I lived in Edmonton I’d but 5 of those. Payments would be just $500 per if you put down $5000. If you can rent them @ $900 you’re instantly cash flow positive! How hard was it to rent out?
No history doesnt mean this won't happen in the future. Having the option to use it is a risk some institutions are not willing to take. Shopping around can help, but not always.

And you're right that unused space isn't debt, but it's possible debt so they can't it.
I have done it. I don't recommend it. The Tarion Warranty is flawed, and doesn't offer the protection that it should. They can string you along for years and years, and then decide to cancel the project, refunding your deposit without any compensation. They can make material changes to the unit and/or building without consulting you and without any penalty. They are incentivized to do as little as possible and use the cheapest possible materials as long as they can meet code, once you sign on the dotted line. At least with resales, you can see the unit, you can read the strata info and minutes, and you have a much better understanding of what you are getting into.
I’ve been with Alterna Bank for a year now. Have a TFSA and regular HISA. So far, I’m pretty happy with them
Honestly, the worse thing is the weather. Our winters are too long and too dry. The community has improved a lot since oil has gone bust. The food scene has exploded. Our river valley is legitimately very nice. You can easily find spots where you can't even tell you're in a city.


The abundance of rednecks is still a problem, but is less noticeable since the bust as well. If you're a guy, dating here still sucks as the gender ratio is going to take a long time to recover.


I mean.. I'm still looking to move somewhere else, but it is certainly becoming a much more livable city than it was.
Best advice is relax, don't get overwhelmed, and start slowly reading up on investing and learn how to do it on your own. It's not hard, and paying someone 1% a year to manage it is a waste that'll cost 100k+ over your lifetime.

Simple version is just buy index funds and hold forever.
We bought pre-construction. I might still do it again, I don't know, but one risk is that a show unit won't necessarily match what you get. In our place, there was a bunch of wonky stuff because of build issues that happened early on in the process - that is, they literally couldn't do anything about them once we got in there. Of course, those warts aren't going to be present in the show unit. 

&#x200B;

That said, whether you buy pre-construction or not, you're almost always going to discover wonky things about your house/unit after you sign the paperwork and move in. Likely even with inspections, etc.
In Alterna’s 2.35% TFSA. My husband and I keep approximately 3 months of expenses in each of ours (so 6 months total). We also keep a bit of cash on hand at home.
As others mentioned a vehicle here is a must as public transport isn’t great. I rented/owned downtown Moncton for years in my 20’s when I was going out to bars/restaurants often but not a great spot to settle longer term. Also, depending on where you are downtown, resale on houses isn’t great. It took me over a year to sell when I was ready to move. Riverview is nice. If you’re working at the airport you might want to look in Dieppe. I travel frequently for work so am now living in Dieppe 5 minutes from the airport which I love. 

You might want to look at renting for 6 months or a year to get to know the city better before making a home purchase.
Would you mortgage a paid off home to invest it?
If values are dropping, all the more reason to sell now, rent, and then buy in 5 when you actually need it, IMO.
HISA
Extremely easy and intuitive!
Can you expand on the part about unnecessarily closing will negatively impact your score? I know credit checks and opening cards will do that, but not closing them?
>However, after 3 pointless visits I went with their recommendation of the Select Growth portfolio and am now contributing $500 per pay period.

They didn't know anything and you gave them your money? Ugh

Yes RBC Investease can be an RRSP account.
Just a note. Alterna doesn’t provide a debit card for their HISA (unless that’s just changed) but they do have a free chequing account. (I did choose Alterna tho since they allow joint accounts).
**December 2013 North American storm complex**

The December 2013 North American storm complex was a significant storm complex that had all sorts of severe weather, including a winter storm, a crippling ice storm and a tornado outbreak that impacted the central and eastern portions of Canada, parts of the Central Great Plains, the Southern United States, and the northeastern United States from December 20 to 23, 2013. Formed in the South Central United States, the storm headed across the Great Plains towards Canada into Atlantic Canada and northeastern United States where the storm dissipated on December 23, 2013. The storm produced freezing rain and snow to the affected areas which caused massive damage to electric power transmission and trees. The storm resulted in 27 deaths, loss of power to over a million residents and over $200 million in damages.

GPS Satellites provide PNT. Position, Navigation, and Timing.

ATMs 100% rely on the timing function for transactions. If the ATM cannot determine accurate time based on the GPS signal, it will not process the transaction.
You’re supposed to do that with any income that is over 50$- even a checking account, in the unlikely event that you have like a million in there and it earns more than 50$
During the 2008/2009 financial crisis it was a real possibility. Not just atms...payroll, overnight lending, money market, etc.
What does gps have to do with atms?
Mine here in BC went up by 100$. It goes up every year by 100 or 50.
Thanks! Want to avoid converting the money now and then convert it back to CAD when I return. I don't need the money right now, so trying to let it sit and earn a few percentage interest.
Cliched, but true quote:

> The best time to start anything was yesterday. The 2nd best time to do it, is always today.
>I've heard quite a few people talk of Roth IRAs, our version of that is the TFSA right?

You got it! Any money coming into a TFSA was already taxed (ex: your pay from work) and no money that is withdrawn or any gains in the account is taxed. It's a very powerful tool for longterm growth, but contributions per year are capped.

>I've also looked into Vanguard before, but it was all a little overwhelming for me back in the day. Looking at that VGRO you mentioned, it doesn't look like it's grown much since inception so what is it that makes it worth it? Do you think it'll start doing better over the years, or am I missing something?

VGRO is an Exchange Traded Fund (like a mutual fund, but you can buy into it on the stock market) that holds shares in a bunch of index funds. Vanguard rebalances the index funds they hold so that you're always invested in 20% bonds and 80% stocks, which is a strategy appropriate for longterm investing because in a stock market crash, those stocks that make up 80% of the portfolio can take years to recover. VGRO is only a little over a year old, so you're probably looking at recent data, but the index funds they contain are many years old. If you're curious, backtesting of the returns of what VGRO would have existed since 2006 can be found here: https://www.canadianportfoliomanagerblog.com/vanguards-hip-new-asset-allocation-etfs/ Index investing is pretty boring and is intended to be very passive - do some reading about it and decide if it's appropriate for you!
Honestly, it's pretty personal depending on how you feel about your money. I think your pretty far ahead of most people your age. Figure out your priorities and then start cutting back on those categories that aren't a priority.

If your honest priority is entertainment, spend your money there. If not start cutting back. Personally, cutting down beer, restaurants (coming healthy meals for yourself is so much better) and just picking our entertainment a little more frugally helped bring us into a cleaner budget.

Look back in a couple months and review and see if you can really live with your choices.
When we moved and couldn't sell, we had to rent (about 7 hours drive from my new job).  We found great renters that became friends with my buddy who was a neighbour, and they appreciated the place.  Everything was going smoothly until the insurance company decided it was "high risk" because we were "absentee landlords" so they increased my premium around $50 a month.  I passed about half of this on to the renter as a legal rent increase.  They could no longer afford the place, so they moved out.  

Fortunately I was able to sell at this point, but what a headache.  I definitely advise against "remote landlording".

I have also heard that unethical management companies want to extract maximum value for your place, so they'll have "essential work" done that you need to pay for which is basically overpriced renovations.  Often the work will be done by one of their associates... 

It's a terrible place to be trapped, and I highly advise against it.
I just go straight cash back. 

ATB worldelite Mastercard (1.5% back on everything)

Scotiabank visa momentum (4% gas and groceries, 2% on recurring bills and pharmacy)

Amex cobalt (5 points for every $ spent at restaurants which can get converted to about 3.5%)

I'd rather just pay for travel using my cashback than use point.
It doesn't matter if you paid in full. They add interest on the instalments.
A glitch on GPS satellites and all ATMs go down. US Military decides to disable civilian use of GPS, all ATMs go down.  It's not as crazy as you might think.
None of the credit cards I have does :-)
how do you figure $60k/year in investment income with less than $1m in the market?

I assume you plan to eat into your principal?
> Debt to income ratio is not a myth.

Unused credit is not debt.

> risk that you will use all that credit (buy too much big things, bad situation happens with big expenses, lose your job and no income for a while, develop an addiction, new expensive girlfriend, wtv the situation) and then you won't be able to repay all the debts.

If the credit history shows no evidence of this happening in the past, this shouldn't matter.

> The mentality is "why do you have so much credit available you don't use if you don't need it?" and that is a concern to them.

Again, with a clean credit history that doesn't show abuse, I don't see the problem.

As other users have mentioned, they have been asked to reduce their credit limits. Some have simply shopped around to void reducing their limits or closing their accounts.

I can definitely see the bank requiring or asking of this if the user has a bad history with credit.
Not exactly. It doesn't affect your score negatively, but almost no-one looks at score alone. They look at how much is borrowed vs how much you earn. If you have a 3-5k balance ebut earn 80k, they won't look twice. If you have 30k on credit cards and earn 40k they will.
At 2019 prices, yes...
In the great depression, I'm sure some of them sat there holding their stocks knowing they'd go back up - but in the meantime they had to eat.
It's different for every institution and depends on what you're applying for.
I understand where you are coming from hahah...life is short, its important to balance enjoyment and financial independence...my neighbor’s husband recently passed away, she tells us that they worked really hard their whole life and have planned out all the activities (traveling) they were going to do once they get there. They were only a few months away from retiring and her late husband was diagnosed with terminal cancer and passed away within 3 months.  It was pretty sad but also a lesson for all of us.
Sold losing positions, bought in again at worse ones as signs of "recovery" showed.
Because there is a risk that you will use all that credit (buy too much big things, bad situation happens with big expenses, lose your job and no income for a while, develop an addiction, new expensive girlfriend, wtv the situation) and then you won't be able to repay all the debts. The mentality is "why do you have so much credit available you don't use if you don't need it?" and that is a concern to them. Debt to income ratio is not a myth. It's definitely something they look when approving credit.
But it forces you to take a much-needed vacation. Cash for investing isn't everything. Sometimes you just need to get away.
No, because churning. I don't use multiple reward credit cards other than for that purpose.
Make sure  the credit cards that are just sitting around dont have annual fees.
No!  I had like 20 dollars worth!
I think Manitoba has the lowest cost of living of the western provinces, and you might have good luck with a high school education. It's not much for growth or social programs.
$70000 should pay for at least tuition for bachelors degree in 15-20 years.
Thanks! I guess the family" bit was throwing me off
 Both are positive credit modifers, with making the full payment slightly better. Remember, credit score shows how well you manage your debt. So some debt is good in this regard.
I received How does where it is accessible make any difference?

Are cans and drunk drivers everywhere now? Alcohol use likely will remain the same. If someone is the type to drive drunk or drink and toss the can, the fact they had to go to a location that sells it a few blocks away wouldn't have prohibited them.

Your deleted posts don't necessarily make you anything. What you were saying in those posts that I still remember is a different story. 

If you thought that was an honest question I apologise because while I thought you were trolling it appears you are just silly, which is fine.
why would i, as someone who works two jobs and doesn't have good financial standing, not buy this?
The Duke has actually really cleaned up it's act in the past few years. Now  'The Duke Live' to promote more live music, which they have some good, decent local bands now. Not many bars in the city do this any more. They seemed to have doubled down. I saw Honeymoon Suite there a couple years ago on my birthday. Carol Pope has played there a couple times too. 

&#x200B;

I've also seen a quite a variety of acts too. They have Robbie Lane, famous in the 60's still playing with a large band on Sunday's I think. And of course the timeless Sweet Daddy Siki doing karoke. What a legend. 

&#x200B;

They have a regular crowd but the rummies are gone I think. The owner tells me he's having issues with the shelter that opened down the street. He's almost needing security everyday now because the addicts and other 'residents' are drawn to the place and he's trying his best to keep them out. I was there when the local city councilor and police rep was in to talk to him about it after he requested a meeting to discuss.

&#x200B;

And the food, try the food!!! Patio weather is coming and they have a big outdoor patio that's great for Sunday brunch.

That sucks. It makes a certain sense, I imagine the logistics and transportation can't be cheap, and they need to cut.

I do hope they keep the digital services; I use those all the time (near daily).
The deep red is Thorncliffe, but the regular red area next to it is very affluent, so I don't know why it's so low, possibly due to rental units that are on Eglinton, idk.
Lol but it will taste so good alongside my cottage cheese and lightly salted potato chips.
lol, you're an idiot
I don't know about back then, but my parents are planning to sell their house for like $850-900k if they ever decide to move and they live in Morningside Heights. Hell even older areas go for more for the lots. No idea why people think it's cheaper to own in Scarborough.
i disagree with you.
Lol, but this a political discussion! The aim is to create confusion and align based on tribal identities including, but, not limited to skin color.
While I could agree with you, the lack of consultation and transparency is still problematic.  Theoretically there may be savings but practically there may not be.  Not taking advice or input could be a shortcut to more and not fewer costs.
Those people have all moved away ... I grew up in North Scarborough in the 80s, hardly anyone I know still lives there. The only people that remain are a couple parents and they're retired.
I have not used any of these services, but surely there should be a closed loop control for the delivery aspect? 

For example, the courier needs to get a PIN from the customer before they can call the job done; that way only when the customer gets the food will it be properly marked delivered. This sounds like an inadequate design and allows the unscrupulous to mess with system.

They say a lot of things. I believe none of them at face value now. 

> It should concern Ford’s government that so many people are so quick to believe the worst of their intentions.

> It’s not hard to see why, either. They have behaved thuggishly on the autism funding file, threatening a professional organization with unspecified trouble if it didn’t praise the new model. They came too late to tolerating harm reduction in the midst of a horrendous epidemic of opioid overdoses, and revoked the licences of three1. safe-injection sites in Toronto over neighbourhood concerns that are in many cases legitimate, but that cannot be allowed to win the day in a matter of life and death. They are making a daily mockery of their campaign pledge of no public sector job losses and no cuts to public services, most recently by increasing class sizes — not the end of the world on its own, but something they have no mandate to do.

> Ford, meanwhile, insists folks have been telling him they want a new motto on their license plates. That isn’t mean or vindictive. It’s just capricious and weird, and that’s not what you want in a premier. If this government can’t build a rudimentary level of trust outside its core voters, it’s going to struggle to sell any remotely unconventional or counterintuitive policy, however defensible it might be, amidst the roar of opposition.

Then you may pay taxes.
If your salary is over $11k, they can't *not* deduct taxes.

Totally wrong.
Credit line is the emergency fund. Everything else is invested. No benefit to being in cash.
Depends on your risk/reward evaluations.  Most personal finance guys seem to think the market stays bullish forever.
You'd think that a history of low utilizilation of all of that available credit would offset any perception of risk.
It’s nice to actually see your money grow.

TD feels like you get pennies back no matter how long that money is sitting in your account
Wait you're supposed to do that? (All my money is in a TSFA so I'm good)
The vast majority of programming doesn't require genius level intellect or skills to do. You just have to be willing to work really hard at a learning, and have a massive tolerance for frustration.

If you're good at mathematical thinking, formal logic, and have an aptitude for not giving up; I'd say it's a pretty good career path.
Thanks for the input. I'm mostly a good saver although I've had to loosen the reigns a bit after the kids showed up. I try not to worry about every little thing anymore and enjoy our time together.
I work in law.   And I agree about house sales.   I would also like to get some value of out my current residence while I can.
I too bank with RBC, but I funded the Questwealth account from my chequing account not an existing TFSA so I wouldn’t expect there to be fees from the RBC side. Appreciate the response!
Yes I they must be ETF's, sorry. Thanks for your input. I'll transfer everything to wealthsimple except the RRSP for now. I'll wait to see what the fees drop to with the current company. Then I can compare. 

Maybe I just feel bad for pulling out of a local business. They haven't really done a bad job of making me money so far. If I didn't know the guy personally it would be different.
Interest is charged based on the scheduled set by lender.  In this case, the lender is choosing to charge annually so there'd be no compounding.
Hey, thanks for the thoughtful reply. 

I’m considering a residence up to about 450 and would definitely plan to be cash flow positive as rents in the city are of a range that would justify the endeavour.   I have numerous family members there that I’d enlist to help me with any issues that may come up.  

The 60 a year came from my financial manager.  I am still contributing about $15,000 a year and with growth I assume that’s where the number came from.   I’m curious about the Trinity Study and will read and discuss with them.
Can I do this for a full time job so that they don't take taxes off my pay and I can just pay come income tax time.
What happens if I check the box but end up going over.
First things first, how long ago is "a few weeks"?  Are we talking 2 weeks or 10?  When did the duplicate transactions first show on your statement?  You're required to report the error within 30 days of receiving the statement.

You can actually dispute the charge straight from their site.  Click on the transaction, click on "Don’t recognize this transaction? Dispute" and file a dispute with details under "Billed multiple times for the same transaction".
You should probably do a bit of research on how credit works before getting a credit card.

To answer your questions, though ..

1. If you don't pay your balance in full before the statement due date, your purchases will accrue interest at the rate of 19.95%/year. This isn't the same as being "overdue", which would be not making your minimum payment before the due date. If you only make minimum payments, you will be charged interest. If you don't make even the minimum payment, your account will be in default (they may close your account, send you to collections, etc.).
2. A balance transfer is when you use credit from your Tangerine account to pay off the balance of another credit card. You will be charged 3% of the amount you transfer, or $5, whichever is more.
3. As a promotional offer, they will charge an interest rate of 1.95%/year on balance transfers for the first six months. After that point, the interest rate returns to the regular rate of 19.95%/year.
4. If you take cash out of an ATM, you will be charged $3.50 (or $5.00 if you're outside Canada).
5. If you take cash out of an ATM, interest will accrue at the rate of 19.95%/year.
6. If you make a payment, and that payment is returned (e.g., your cheque bounces), you will be charged $25.
7. If you make a purchase that puts your balance over your credit limit, you will be charged $25.
8. If you need a new card couriered to you, instead of waiting for it to arrive in the mail, you will be charged $25.

A note on cash advances and balance transfers: The interest-free grace period **does not apply**. You will be charged interest from the date of the advance/transfer, regardless of whether the balance is paid off before the statement due date or not.
You're right, plenty of time over here haha. It will certainly be a while before I buy any real estate,
If you carry a balance but make more than the minimum payment does still affect your credit score in a negative way?
Each of you claim:

Thanks for the response! Yeah, that's one of the big things I'm balancing here. The work in Vancouver or elsewhere would almost certainly pay better than where my home currently is, but the cost of living is much greater. I guess I'd have to weigh that out when the time came. 

I'll probably be getting trying a co-op through my university for an intership/work, so I may have the opportunity to experience what you're talking about on a short-term scale.
Canopy Growth Corp
> "Goods not received"

Just a double charge, actually.
That's not true. If you're looking to rent a new place, you need to care about your credit score. Many landlords/property management do a credit check or ask for a credit report when taking applications.
No
ask them if line of credit is eligible. i had to pay off a rbc loc from a BT promo on my scotia amex. they sent a bank draft to RBC and deposited the money to my RBC LOC. try if it can work the same way for TD.
A small spin, I have some in chequing accounts and low interest savings account. Some ppl are saying change banks to get >2% interest, but for me, its better to consolidate the accounts than to get 1% on a small portion of my money - for the convience/ease of tracking, and laziness/distrust to create new accounts at smaller firms. Most of my money is investments, not in HISA.

I have probably about $6,000 in such accounts, which is a very small portion of my total net assets anyways.
Thanks a lot for the thoughtful response! I'm realizing from the few responses on this post that my view on real estate may be slightly slanted due to my lack of research and encouragement from relatives. We live in a lower-end area on Vancouver Island so the house prices aren't the absurd Vancouver prices but I'll definitely set out to do more research after this and look at those suggested books.

As for discount brokerage accounts, I've been a reader over at wallstreetbets and have witnessed some real horror shows... that coupled with one of my friend's parent's enormous loss on the weed stocks (bought in Sept. and sold in Dec. not sure of the thought process there) you mentioned I think are enough to scare me away from that stuff. I think I'll sell off the bitcoin soon.

I've heard quite a few people talk of Roth IRAs, our version of that is the TFSA right? 

I've also looked into Vanguard before, but it was all a little overwhelming for me back in the day. Looking at that VGRO you mentioned, it doesn't look like it's grown much since inception so what is it that makes it worth it? Do you think it'll start doing better over the years, or am I missing something?

Thanks again!
> I had a 93% grade in physics 12, but the way people talk about computer science it sounds intimidating.

&#x200B;

Have you written a small script, application, or anything like that? If that does not interest you, development is not for you. Alternatively, you may want to look into network administration or something more hands on if you prefer tinkering with computers.
For those who plan on investing their emergency fund in a HISA, keep in mind that you do get a T5 slip, which you have to report as part of your tax return.
Failure to report income penalty wouldn't apply in the case of not filing a return at all. It's when you, for example, file your taxes and don't include income from one of your jobs.

OP is going to owe interest on the amount they didn't pay, and possibly late-filing penalties and interest if they have an amount owing from the years that haven't been filed yet. It'll depend on their tax situation .. if they're a basic T4 earner without much else going on, they may have a refund for every one of those years (plus GST/HST credits, Trillium payments, etc.).
Yeah, I know. I don't follow the PFC echo chamber that says I should keep 6 months expenses laying around losing value.

I have sufficient income and assets that it isn't necessary. Might not be true for everyone, but I answered the question.
You're assuming you don't owe anything but you don't know this for sure as you haven't filed your taxes.  It's very rare that employers take off exactly the right amount for taxes over the course of a year.

Better yet, you might even be owed money by the government and that amount over the course of 8 years could add up to thousands of dollars.
>What does this job entail exactly.

&#x200B;

Sales.

But it is unlikely they will hire a sales rep with only a high school degree. Most sales executives, especially in corporate Canada have a few years under their belt - no one will take a 20 year old high school graduate, ex-factory worker seriously, unless he is selling factory machinery.

&#x200B;

Sales runs the gamut, with junior / low end sales people making $50 - $75K+ commission to higher end executives with $150 - $200K base + commission. How much they pay often comes down to the complexity of the sale and experience required to close a deal.
All I’m going to say is don’t be in a hurry to spend the money. Finish your undergrad first, figure out what you want to do next. Maybe you will go to grad school, maybe to the US for employment or move provinces. Point is, there are too many variables in my opinion for you to purchase a real estate on top of the fact you currently have no substantial income.

Finish the undergrad first at least and then look into buying a real estate.
Would this be your first credit card?  Are you comfortable with how credit cards work?
> I'm capable of university but have no idea what to study, or what the job market is like for graduates.

&#x200B;

That depends on what you study... your job is paying good money, you should milk it for all it's worth. But in the meantime, I suggest you get a degree, perhaps via distance education. Check out Athabasca University in Alberta - it's a public University that is primarily virtual.
My bank, RBC, charged a 50.00 fee when I transferred my TFSA of 20,000 to Questrade. 

Questrade reimbursed me for it
Probably. Buy once, cry once. A P226 is on my list. Glocks and M&Ps are the more budget friendly choices though.
Thanks so much! I'm really excited for it and am eager to learn more, practicing everyday.  I have a lot of experience in business, operations, team leadership and project management - so I think I have a good foundation for working in any business environment... But those roles are roles that came to me VS being goals of mine.  At heart, I really like to create (am a lifelong musician) and I love reading/learning and languages.  Growing up I always thought code would be too complicated.... But it wasn't until I started dabbling in it that I realized it was right up my alley. Definitely gets me into a groove the way playing musical instruments or speaking a new language does.  Plus the flexibility and opportunity to work remote are huge pluses to me.

Anyways, I'm excited. Thanks for your reply and sharing your thoughts on it!
She's too optimistic. Prices are on the decline because they were insane to begin with. There's a higher chance of you losing another 20% than hitting the 1.5m
I see thanks. I wonder what the impact is of closing credit you have already accepted
I sold at a loss on value, but i'd paid my mortgage for 8 years, so I walked away with $2,000 in my pocket at the end of everything after lawyer fees, realtor fees, etc.

Exact, when I was shopping for a professional student LoC (125k), a bank accepted only if I closed my 3 existing credit cards and took theirs. I went to TD, told them I want the LOC and keep my cards and they were fine with that.
Thanks man, awesome tips.
I renewed my Home insurance recently in Alberta. My home insurance went up significantly from the previous year despite nothing changing. I shopped around and still had to pay several hundred more than last year.
I echo others comments. Here is also an article fromMoney Sense that might help when deciding between tfsa and rrsp. 

https://www.moneysense.ca/save/investing/tfsa/tfsa-vs-rrsp-decision/
A lot can happen in 5 years so it's probably best to be prepared in general. There's no downside to maintaining good credit.
Yes do the VDP.
Is this actually launched yet? I’ve been trying to find a price and can’t find it anywhere.
It’s good you have 50k liquid cash for emergency fund.  I would continue to contribute to RRSP for tax deduction though. 

Below is a good article from Money Sense, hope this helps. 🙂

Being in software development feels like playing life on easy mode. There is so much money in the industry, and so many job opportunities. The working conditions seem much better than other fields with equal pay. I could never get a raise from my starting salary and still live comfortably for a very long time. Good luck with learning Python! It is a great language to start off with.
Whats it like when dealing with bills and transferring money to wealthsimple or things like that?

Easy?
Any year you didn’t file an income tax return is a year you didn’t report your income. Having taxes deducted from your paycheque is not the same thing as reporting your income.

**Northeast blackout of 2003**

The Northeast blackout of 2003 was a widespread power outage throughout parts of the Northeastern and Midwestern United States and the Canadian province of Ontario on August 14, 2003, beginning just after 4:10 p.m. EDT.Some power was restored by 11 p.m. Most did not get their power back until two days later. In other areas, it took nearly a week or two for power to be restored.

Parents set aside $xxx amount of dollars for me to go to school. I had the option: use the money they set aside for school and not work hard vs. Work my ass off to get scholarship money and keep whatever was leftover at the end. I chose option B and my parents signed over to me a nice downpayment for my house after I finished school. 

My parents understood what motivated me and it worked.
If the house ends up being sold, and your sitting on cash;

Decide if you intend on staying in Vancouver long-term upon graduation. Having a CS degree, deciding to stay would likely offer you a lower salary then if you relocated to the States or out east mind you.

*If you decide to stay,* put the money into GIC's so you can make a safe 2-3% on that cash until you graduate. Once graduated, and finding work, take that matured cash and put it towards a massive down-payment on a condo. You'd then have a small mortgage payment, good salary, and therefore a nice cash flow for whatever you want.

*If you decide to relocate somewhere;* It will really depend where you end up, but you'd likely be renting as opposed to owning if it was in the states. In this scenario let that cash pile grow by starting a portfolio of index funds and GIC's/Bonds. Don't rely on needing this money for the near term however, as anything could happen and the only sure-fire way to win at investing is having a long-term outlook. To give you an idea of the reward here however, 250k invested earning an average of 7% a year would be worth 2M in 30 years.
This. I opened my credit card app last week and there was a message asking if I accept an increase in credit. I had to press yes or no and accept. I haven't had this card very long and haven't had credit cards for years. I called the company asking if this was legitimate, she said it was, they are just confirming my decision to accept the increase in my account limit.
What’s an emergency fund? 

*cries violently and curses millennial debt*
It will comes down to how much time you are willing to "sacrifice". If you have enough determination to study throughout the semester and have a good work ethic, you should have no problem at all graduating. Even the people who barely graduate still end up with jobs above the medium income of Canadian's. 

If you are serious about this, I would recommend trying to learn the basics to see if it is something you like doing. I personally find it is a very satisfying job with a lot of interesting problems to solve, other people I know don't love programming but like the salary and benefits that come with it.
Well to provide an anecdote: when I refinanced my mortgage last year they did indeed care about old credit cards and a line of credit that I wasn't using but that still showed up on my account but the bank basically jusy asked me to close them as a condition of being approved for the loan. So it's not necessarily that they will just reject your application, they may just ask you to close out other forms of credit as a condition for being approved for your mortgage/personal loan/etc. This may depend on the lender and type of loan and I'm not a professional in this industry. But my understanding is that it's better to have a line of credit that you don't need rather than apply for one when you do and when you may have a harder time being approved for it.

I use four cards, but almost all my spending is one two of them. 

I use the PC World Elite Mastercard as my primary card.  (1% cashback everywhere or 3% cashback at Superstore)
I use the Costco Capital 1 card, only for gas and restaurants or bars (2 or 3% cashback)
I have the HomeTrust Visa for any foreign currency transactions. 
I have a BMO AirMiles MasterCard which I just use for AirMiles bonuses - which I’m slowly accumulating for a free trip.  

The BMO AirMiles card is the one I’m least attached to, and I really just got it for a 500 bonus miles for signing up.  Otherwise, everything else is essentially cashback.

Both! Nurture existing clients and generate new revenue. It really depends on the industry you're in and what book of accounts you're managing. Every customer facing job you will ever have has some sort of "sales" aspect to it. Worked for a bank for 1.5 years while I studied and I had more pressure to "sell" there than my current job.

I'm an AE in the tech industry, first year base $61k and I made about an extra $15k in commission in my first year totalling $76k at 21 years old. Work from home 2/3 days a week, go for lunches with existing/new clients, lots of meetings in your given territories. 

My book of accounts is at the bottom of the ladder, but my friends at the office that have Major or National accounts have a base around $70-80k and their average deal size is ridicously larger than mine but the commission rate is the same so these guys are making well over $100k.
To those of you who chose EQ over Alterna, what were your reasons? Does EQ provide a debit card for their HISA (I think Alterna does)? Can anyone confirm.
I grew up on Weldon St. Yes, there is some prostitution and drug use in the downtown area, but I never felt I was in danger as a kid living in the area. 

Generally, the best area to settle down in tends to be Dieppe or Moncton north (which is actually more like north-west... Evergreen area) but I really liked living downtown as a kid. Especially with the new event centre on Main, the area isn't as awful as some people think.

Edit to add: Shediac is fine. I know several people who live there. The problem there is that every single day all summer long the main street in Shediac backs up from the beach to the highway. It takes forever to get through town all summer long.
No, I just got the personal (unsecured) line at motusbank for 5.65%.  Already had a HELOC with Tangerine at 4.60%.
Ive tried and their customer service is horrible. If it wasnt my only credit card i would have cancelled right there. Had a few hundred on it from xmas and the rep basically laughed and said i could cancel once it was paid off, as if it was going to take ages.
I already have a very good job by many people's standards, but am looking to pivot to software development (programming) within the next 5 years because of the flexibility and demand.  Great advice is for anyone to start learning code really.  I'm going down the Python path myself.
It's actually a technology course so I'd need 2 more years to be an engineer. But yeah, the field is very broad. You do biomedical engineering stuff, audio electronics,
Some job titles would be instrument technician, electronic technician. Really, It's very broad. You can do some design stuff but that's usually engineers. You are troubleshooting a lot or building stuff. But yeah, you could repair cell phones or computers. Think little things you need to solder. There is also the side of programming micro controllers. Think PLCs (programmable logic controllers) and firmware for software to communicate with hardware. That was a really cool part for me and it was one of my chosen electives! 

I am not really in my field. I'm a power electrician/operator but I have a backup plan if something goes wrong and it opens up options in my Corporation.
I'm not a financial expert, but there are a few things I could suggest to maximize your income.

1. 1.05% interest rate for a savings account is horrible. Even EQBank's non promotional interest rate is 2.3%, however DUCA credit union is offering 3% interest until January 31 2020, so do that immediately.

2. Take advantage of new customer bank promotions. Tangerine has the $150 offer, and Simplii has a $200 offer (Both of which I am currently doing also.)

3. Could probably reduce the cost of food down a bit. Maybe buy in bulk or do meal prep.

4. Gym for $60 a month is kind of high. Planet fitness is only $25 a month and you get their Black card membership.

Your credit score is top notch though. Just keep out the grind. I could suggest moving to a new city altogether where the cost of living is pretty low.
ESSO sold their entire Retail business and various entities now utilize the ESSO marketing but are owned by a parent company, e.g. Parkland or 7-11.
It's for the term. But trying to predict what your situation will be over the next five years and having zero flexibility neither your choice of lender or rate is a big roll of the dice.
You're not dreaming. We sold our home and bought one here outright. It's so nice to be mortgage free early in life.

Shediac is 90% French from what I've seen and it's decently far from the City. Roughly a 30 minute drive. 

That map is pretty spot on but I'd be leery buying anything on or near St. George Street. That whole section should be a red zone.
Smartest answer here imo.  Not sure why everyone is jumping off a cliff to become a landlord.  It's not for the faint of heart or inexperienced.
So it isn't the high level, high paying, strategic and creative thinking that I'm naively thinking?
Thank you very much, I've passed this along.
Mortgage agent here, same difference
I'm all for renewables and diversification.

but this is garbage. Canada didn't invest 200$ bn, most of that was from private companies. That investment simply wouldn't exist if it wasn't oil. you can't compare like that.
What does this job entail exactly. Your given a list of already established clients, and you just cater to them and keep them happy? Or is this sales?
Dude... just buy. If you are scared, buy 10% of your portfolio biweekly to mitigate ups and down. Though if your portfolio is under 50k then it doesn't really matter. Just get in the game.
I meant the voluntary disclosure program.
Sure, you should always shop around regardless.
Such as?
How 'intense' are these programs? I'm not stupid, I spend waaay too much time on the computer already, and think I had a 93% grade in physics 12, but the way people talk about computer science it sounds intimidating.

So you're looking at around $25k cash when your mom passes away. The rest may not be for many years. If you eventually want to buy property, $25k is a nice start to a down payment.
Thanks, how about university area?

Just dont invest in dividend heavy companies
The comment I replied to referenced tuition, so I used that as a baseline for comparison.

I also said I was assuming zero tax sheltered investment growth in the RESP, which is unrealistically pessimistic. 

You're not wrong, obviously shelter and food are necessities. But those are also things that a person would need regardless of if they're a student or not, and are going to vary alot depending on an individual's circumstances. Assuming the worst case, from a cost of living perspective (student living away from home in a high CoL city), then I would agree that a maxed out RESP with respectable investment growth probably wouldn't be sufficient to cover 4 full years.
Electronics engineering, so like repairing cell phones and computers, or am I way off? What would the job title be so I can lookup some postings and see what they pay around me?

I do think I would like that, all the troubleshooting without the heavy lifting in something like being a mechanic.
1) Wealthsimple doesn't have mutual funds. They have ETF portfolio.

2) Move your RRSP at 2% to WealthSimple (check for the fees of your mutual fund because there will be some)

3) Same for your wife for RRSP

4) For your TFSA, move all to WealthSimple if theses for long term investing.

5) Wife should do the same for her TFSA

6) Have an emergency fund that covers 6 months of expenses

7) invest in both TFSA and RRSPs if you can (depends on your monthly expenses).
Just curious, what happens when you sell at a loss.. Do you now just owe the bank 50gs?or do you have to declare bankruptcy?
all kinds of things
Eligible dividends are paid out of earnings that have been taxed at the high corporate rates (annual profits over $500k).  Non-eligible dividends are typically what are paid out by small businesses, since profits are less than $500k and are taxed at the small business rate.
To pay eligible dividends, your corporation must have balance in the notional GRIP account (General Rate Income Pool).

Broadly, a corporation accumulates a balance in their GRIP account if it has earned profit that was subject to the high corporate tax rate rather than the low rate. As a small business, I would not expect this to be the case for your corporation. 

Read more here; [https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/corporations/eligible-dividends/general-rate-income-pool-grip.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/corporations/eligible-dividends/general-rate-income-pool-grip.html)

To answer your questions;

1. Public companies and companies that have sufficient earnings they can't utilize the small business deduction corporate tax rate can pay eligible dividends.

2. Likely not, assuming your corporation is using the small business deduction rate (broadly, less than $500,000 in taxable profit annually).
The employment info comes from your creditors; some of them report it and some don't. My Equifax report shows my occupation from when I was 18. 

Don't worry about it.
I would probably go Spousal RRSPs so you get the tax deduction and your wife can withdraw in a lower bracket than you in retirement
Higher credit score means your credit utilization will  average out lower in proportion to what you normally use. Better for credit.
Worthwhile? It's the law to file tax returns especially if you owe money. Don't worry, CRA will take that $300 from any refund you would get.
Whoop, my apologies !
Still trying to figure this taxing of the RRSPs out.

If I have 300K in RRSPs and move to Florida, they are going to want tax them in some manner? Possibly, 

tax the yearly contributions going into it? If marginal is 2% that is $120 per year.

tax what is already into it. If the tax on RRSP is marginal, marginal is a fairly broad term. If marginal is 2% for example that would be $9K taken out everyone year?

tax the gain (selling without selling): on 300K this could mean $15,000 taken out?

Is anyone one of these terrible scenarios remotely possible?
DUCA is good also. 3% until jan 31 2020.
I have about $90k in a pension plan so it won't be too much by the time I retire.

Wife won't have any pension. Hopefully some cash when she sells the business but we're not counting on anything significant from that.

&#x200B;

>If you are just buying 2 percent GICs in your TFSA you would be better off paying down your 3 percent mortgage.

&#x200B;

It would be in standard Wealthsimple ETFs.
*Maybe* 2 might. Most won't due to AML and compliance issues that take up time and money for the company.

Why not park it with you in whatever country you're in?
Do you know what that limit might be (as a percentage of ones annual income)?
I’m trying to think of what would have to happen for all atms to go down for 4 days. I feel like cash wouldn’t be a necessity as there likely is a lot more shit going down.
Since the home is your primary home and ordinarily lived in by you, as long as you report the rental income of a room rental or basement, you can still claim the full exemption, *for the most part*. CRA has been cracking down on this.

Specifically related to the basement rental, CRA interpretation bulletins, it appears that the **CRA’s position is that if the basement unit is fully self-contained** ***and*** **is rented on an on-going basis will cause a change in use.** If on the other hand, the basement has a shared entrance or if the rental of the unit is periodic and sporadic, it is unlikely a change in use would be triggered.

1) The portion of the property used for rental is small in proportion to the whole property,

2) You do not make any structural changes to make it more suitable for rental purposes, and

3) You do not claim capital cost allowance on the part of your rental.

Meeting these requirements means the property continues to qualify as a principal residence.

So if it is a self-contained apartment in your basement, the portion of the basement relative to the sqft of the whole house is not exempt from capital gains.
CT techs are not "mechanics". 
I don't even know what they are. But whatever it is they're on the same level as a jiffy lube oil changer.
It's coming from what each of us will receive I think. I think my step dad will be living in the house for the foreseeable future, but I plan to move back home so I have somewhere to live anyways.
Have they done anything more complex than a tire rotation?
Hey OP, you've got a tough situation that no one should have to shoulder at 18 and I just want to say that you show a lot of maturity that I really respect. The good news is that if you don't make any rash decisions, these funds will essentially guarantee you'll live a happy life without any financial stress. You should think about cash preservation and lifelong investments- if you invest now in a responsible plan that is sheltered from tax, you'll start to see great compound returns as you enter professional life after university and know you'll be able to retire peacefully while your colleagues start to stress about the future.

I'd do some reading through the sidebar about investing. Millionaire Teacher and Beat The Bank are great books that I think a lot of Canadians should pick up at the library. At 18, opening up a TFSA with a discount brokerage or a roboadvisor will allow you invest $6000 this year and pay no tax on any future earnings. I think it's interesting that you're considering real estate but not security investing- the former requires massive investments of your time/resources and exposes you to many risks, especially in the West coast market. Unless you live in the property, your gains on the property's value won't be sheltered from tax like a TFSA would be! A discount brokerage gives you the tools to make some outrageously bad decisions if you aren't careful (weed stocks lol), but since you already own Bitcoin it sounds like you have a keen sense of risk vs reward already. Consider using your TFSA contribution room first for long-term growth before gambling with real estate- heck, you could even just invest your TFSA in real estate trusts that buy property for you if that's what you're into!

Personally, I put all my TFSA account into Vanguard asset allocation funds (I use VGRO). I trust their knowledge and reputation to invest my money in bonds and an incredibly diverse range of stocks for long-term growth. I just need to login a few times throughout the year to buy more VGRO in my discount brokerage- few critical decisions that could cause me to implode my life and I can focus on my career instead of the stock market.
Actually I have. Firefighting sounds super cool, and I'm thinking of applying to the volunteer program once it opens. EMS sounds interesting too, but I heard the pay is absolute garbage (here in BC at least), are you able to offer any insight into that?
I've had canadian tire re-seal my tire bead after it developed a leak while in storage. Two years in a row they give it back equal or worse the first try.

Any time they've taken a tire off my car, they just impact wrench each lug nut down to full torque in one go. That causes the tire to seat unevenly an rumble at high speeds.

I don't mind using them for harmless stuff like that because if anything, Canadian Tire has a rock solid returns/customer service policy. They might seal my tire twice every time, but I at least know I'm only paying once.
As long as you don't live in Quebec you could use [StudioTax for the Mac.](https://www.studiotax.com/en/?page=11)  After you have finished your return you will have the option to Netfile your  return or to print a condensed/ for the government pdf that you can mail in.
Planning to max out and let the kids choose what they would like to do, even if it seems flaky. (I have a Masters in Fine Arts in Creative Writing, so who am I to judge?) It is possible to make a living on the arts, but for most, it requires a lot of hustle and scraping by.

We are in a very fortunate position that I can likely support my kids in doing whatever they want, whether that's poet or plumber. But my bottom line is, whatever they do, they have to work at it. Rather than pretend they don't have economic privilege, I'd rather instill in them the idea that having privilege means using it for something meaningful. 

If that's plumbing, great. Go to trade school, get a job or start a business and hustle. If that's poetry, fine. Write, build community, submit your work, take classes, find mentors, apply for grants, teach, etc. I don't care that much what it is, as long as it's clear that they are working seriously at it.

If they aren't working at something, then I'm not funding lazy.
Edmonton is cold as fuck
Many people have never moved out from their parents and have been saving, as well their parents may be ready to downsize and gift them a down payment.
So you think it's still worthwhile even if I don't owe anything? I guess it doesn't hurt to do it anyway?
From [https://www.taxtips.ca/personaltax/propertyrental/changeinuse.htm](https://www.taxtips.ca/personaltax/propertyrental/changeinuse.htm)

# What if I Rent Out Part of My Home or Cottage, or Have a Home Office?

When you rent out a part of your home or cottage, or convert part of your home to a home office, you are considered to have changed the use of that part of the home from personal-use to rental property.  Depending on the circumstances, when you eventually sell your home, or have a deemed disposition because you stop renting part of it, you may have to report a capital gain on the portion of your home that you rented out.

The CRA [Rental Income Tax Guide](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4036.html), T4036, and [S1-F3-C2: Principal Residence](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/technical-information/income-tax/income-tax-folios-index/series-1-individuals/folio-3-family-unit-issues/income-tax-folio-s1-f3-c2-principal-residence.html) (see partial changes in use) state that if all of the following conditions are met, you will not be considered to have a change in use:  
    \- the part of the home used for rental purposes is small in relation to the size of the whole property,  
    \- you do not make any structural changes to the property to make it more suitable for rental purposes, and  
    \- you do not claim any capital cost allowance on the part you are using for rental purposes.

If all of the above conditions are met, you will not have to report a capital gain when the property is sold or the rental is stopped.  Otherwise, you will have to report a capital gain based on the portion of the house that was rented.

If you rent out a part of your home, CRA's position is that you may only write off losses against other income if you have a "reasonable expectation of profit" from the property rental.

See all our articles related to [Property Rentals](https://www.taxtips.ca/realestate.htm#property-rental).
You are forgetting food, rent, and all those other things you need to live.
Did you read the post?
This is open to interpretation, and depends a lot on building structure and the like. Generally, a secondary suite where rental income tax was claimed does not affect the PRE. Even if it does, it is limited at worst to the square footage/assessment of value of the secondary suite. If you've got, for example, a duplex with a second entrance, that would absolutely only be eligible for the PRE for the percentage of the house that is considered the primary residence.

Go ahead and tick the box but if you get a second job when you doing the TD1 for it consider if the combined income will put you above the basic personal amount.  (Otherwise you could get a nasty surprise when you do your tax return for that year.)
Sorry for the unrelated question, but what do you do that earns you that impressive 140k salary?

Also consider that house sales are dropping dramatically (at least here in BC), and therefore prices likely will follow.
People spending all the money they make is a universal problem. Tobias again:

> Most of us feel like we couldn't get by on a penny less. But all a family struggling to get by on $190,000 a year needs to do is look down the street to a family that - somehow - manages to get by on $165,000 a year. (They do their own pool maintenance.) A family struggling on $28,000 need only look down the street to see one surviving - don't ask me how - on $22,500.

But if you want an alternative source of advice on making a budget, here's [a booklet from Alberta Consumer and Corporate Affairs](https://archive.org/details/2000adguidetofin00albe_1).
I haven't had any income that the government doesn't know about. My taxes are already paid with employer deductions. So I shouldn't be facing any failure to report income or late filing penalties, since I don't believe I would owe anything in any other years.  
  
It's just about that rental thing. Which, if I've read it correctly, the penalty shouldn't be very much I guess.
Probably RRSP or spousal RRSP if you want your wife to have a bigger retirement fund. Spousal would make more sense if you have a pension as I doubt your wife does.

Everyone is saying TFSA first but it really depends what you are investing in. If you are just buying 2 percent GICs in your TFSA you would be better off paying down your 3 percent mortgage. 

Contribute to your RRSP, take your decent taxing savings and reinvest in RRSP, TFSA or RESP.
Private corps are non-eligible dividends.

Edit: because of the small business status. You would pay more corporate tax. Ends up a wash.
I paid for my schooling with loans and work. I was in school for 5.5 years and finished with 2 degrees. When i finished i had $28,000 in student loans. My dad then gave me $14,000 to pay for half of my loan and i paid $14000 over the course of 1.5 years.
EQ is good interest and good user interface. Signing up was easy. I haven't had a run-in with their customer service.

Once you have an account it's super easy to open bolt-on accounts for different savings purposes or buy GICs if you have a rigid timeline for savings.

There are better interest rates out there, but I can't be bothered to move for only a few dollars difference.
Can you just give them a credit card over the phone or mail a cheque?
Do the VDP: [https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/voluntary-disclosures-program-overview.html#joe](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/voluntary-disclosures-program-overview.html#joe)
After the emergency fund I would focus on the TFSAs.  Before contributing to an ~~RRSP~~ RESP you should have a plan for retirement savings, which may include eventually using the RESP contribution for retirement savings.  

Don't rush to contribute to an RESP until you are confident that you won't need that money before the beneficiaries start post secondary school. (The 20% CESGs are great but if you need to dip into the RESP for any reason they will go right back to the governments and you will have no way to reclaim them.) You can postpone contributing to an RESP and when you are catching up you can get the CESG on up to $5000 per year of contributions.   For example, a subscriber who contributes $4500 per year starting in the year when the beneficiary turns 10 would still collect the maximum grants.

Edit to fix misleading typo.
Correct.
Credit utilization is good for your credit score if you're using less than 30% and paying it off on time.

Available credit is a negative for big loans, mortgages etc.

Available credit is effectively "how much you *could* soon end up owing if shit hit the fan. If you're looking to buy a home and you have $100,000 of combined credit available, that's a bit of a red flag to lenders.

That means you're capable of entering into a mortgage and then instantly racking up $100,000 of other debt that could destabilize you.

In general, my favourite advice is to keep it simple. 1-3 cards are all you really need to cover you in all circumstances.
Apartment rentals are pretty sought after in the area especially in law suites as they are decently hard to find.

Nothing wrong with trying Airbnb I just dont think it will be worth it so keeping your options open is a good idea
Chequeing account for easy instant access.
Forsure. I agree with all of this. Was my train of thought as well.
Yes after selling.
You are braver than I am.  Being a landlord seems to be setting yourself up for trouble with tenants eventually.  My preference has been to only borrow to increase my RRSP; take that reduction in taxes and apply them back against the original debt.  Keep an eagle-eye on the rest of the debt repayment and work at growing the RRSP assets.

To each his own of course....that "disappearing down some nonsense" is pain, honestly earned.  I'm told the scars fade eventually!
The bank asked me to lower my LoC to 5k from 30k when I got my mortgage. They told me come back after 6 months to have it raised back to 30k.
So much this. I was incredibly privileged to have parental support throughout my education to cover anything. It allowed me the freedom to:  
1. Pursue a degree I was interested in and would excel in vs. one based on short term financial goals (I didn't have to pay back a loan - I could take what many would consider a meaningless art history degree that I loved and graduate at top of my class teaching me the value of education. A lot of people say boo to 'non-practical' degrees as though practical degrees actually prepare you for something - but curiosity and the joy of learning is probably the most elastic skill you need in today's job market)

2. The freedom to use the time I spent working to focus on resume building & figuring out what I wanted to do vs. trying to simply earn money (I hunted down art history jobs, realized they would never pay me anything, and then took a poorly paid summer internship in an ad agency all because I was financially able to do so - all of which helped me figure out what I actually wanted to do)

3. The confidence to take risks because I had a financial safety net (totally privilege person perspective, but lots of entrepreneurs go that route because they know they won't literally be destitute if they fail. The whole idea that financial stress is a motivator is a whole lot of malarky that has been psychologically proven to be untrue over and over for the vast majority of people - so why do this experiment on your children when behavioural scientists have already done it for you?)
For sure. Thought about also buying a second house with a suite and renting half/Air bnb the other half.

It seriously feels like a magical cloud world where I have to unlearn everything about life in Vancouver. Im open to it.
You won't go to jail.

If your income will be less then the $11k, they won't deduct taxes.
You accused Canadians that care about the environment of being pyromaniacs participating in some tinfoil hat wearer conspiracy and when people call you on your bullshit you cry bullying. Lol
>We've transferred our funds from Mackenzie Financial to Wealthsimple.

Smart move.

Yes, having your emergency fund back up is step one. 

6 years left on a car loan...yikes.

You both should load up your and your wife's TFSAs first.

Followed by RRSPs. Since her contribution limit iow, no reason to contribute to that now. 

RESP is last. It's nice to help the kids, but if your own retirement plans aren't happening, no point in trying to help someone else.
I suspect that the thing you have wrestled the most with is the $40,000.   If you are earning $55,000 you certainly won't want to pop it all in your RRSP right away.  [This RetailInvestor](http://www.retailinvestor.org/rrsp.html#delay) discussion will help you decide if at some point you will want to make an RRSP contribution and delay the deduction.  (It is seldom the best option but it might be at some point in the future.)  

If you anticipate that it will take a long time to be able to make $40,000 of RRSP contributions that will all be deducted in the higher tax bracket perhaps some of the $40,000 could be used for RRSP contributions now and/ or some could be used to make a larger down payment.
Sorry to hear that about your mom!  
  
Will your stepdad pay the $20k debt or will the three of your split it from what you each receive? Also is he planning to sell the house in the near future? Without knowing the terms of the will, you likely wouldn't have access to any funds from the house until he sells it, no?
Hosting a house for 100 dollars a night on airbnb vs renting it for 1400 give or take a few hundred dollars and I think you are better of just having somebody sign a lease but best of luck to you.
that's not the same as raising your limit without you consenting. you still have to consent to their pre-approved offer - before the rules changed, you could receive an increase and have to call in to decline it.
I'm 30. Wife is 29. I'm taking courses and training in order to walk away from my Red Seal trade job for good and take a long shot at a new career. We'll have all but her car ($200/mth) paid off by end of May. At that point, we'll finally start actually saving for retirement. Do I wish we'd started last year, never mind 5 years ago? Sure. But I also wish I had never finished my apprenticeship and instead had pursued a better job, so there's that too. 

Don't look back. Tear that damn rearview mirror off. We can't change the choices we made in the past. We can only learn from them and move forward.
If you are renting a room or basement, the rental income is income reported to the CRA. That gets added on to your personal tax return. Then you pay whatever tax based on that. 

I have no idea what you mean in your 3rd paragraph "So landlords doing this would **break even ONLY after accumulating enough rental income that would match the amount of capital gains tax**. They need to consider tax burden for rental income and impact on tax bracket too."

What capital gains are you talk about? After you sell the primary residence?
I hear maxing out your HELOC to go all in on Bitcoin SV is the hot new trend!
Whats EQ like?

I'm with TD, thinking about moving my HISA
Turn it into a down payment on a rental property if your income allows?
So you never filed tax returns in the last 8 years?
Would be surprised. Even to host for $100/Night you are in the black.
You only get the match for 14 of those years. But you were conservative with your return so your point still stands.
Thank you for the huge respond, I have more questions for you- the suite option is looking better by the minute, I will hold a 2 or 400 dollar mortgage so a 6-700 suite would be perfect. Oh my god- financial relief and home ownership? Am I dreaming!?

We are also looking at Shediac.

Would you consider this accurate?

It would help if you added city/province.  Here in Alberta insurance has not gone up across the board, yet.
https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/interest-penalties.html

There is a section on penalties for repeatdly failing to report income.
That's exactly what the OP asked about doing 😂
I like the cash at house angle and I wholeheartedly agree with the necessity to be "perfectly liquid".
Yeah that's not an emergency fund, just an ETF holding you're willing to take a big loss on.
The majority is held in my Tangerine HISA. Haven't bothered moving it to gain an extra 1/4 percent. Not worth it for me.  I also keep a hundred bucks cash in my wallet and a couple hundred at home.
Canadian tire replaced my brakes calipers and roters 3 times in 2 weeks even though the ones I had on were less than a year old. After charging me for that they discovered the real problem was my hand brake line. Safe to say when they tried to charge me for that I asked for a refund on all the stuff I paid for that they changed for no reason. Still going to court for this. 

A friend of mine went for an oil change, they drained his oil and never put new oil in. The car seized before it made it out of the parking lot. 

No good mechanics stay there. Once they learn enough they leave to work at a real shop. They have such a high turnover. Just look at their mechanics most of them are super young.
Yes you should include it because the CRA tracks the portion of your income that comes from commissions. Including income in box 42 will not have any affect your return other than transmitting that info to the CRA (it will not double count your income for example). Also mentioned by others was the fact that you could deduct certain expenses you paid to earn employment income buy only if:

* the expenses are incurred because they were required by your employer
* you do not receive an allowance or an allowance is not included in your income

If you do qualify to claim expenses, then form T777 can be used to calculate the amount of deductions you can make. Form T2200 should also be filled out by your employer and you should keep a copy in case CRA asks for a copy.
M&P9 for me.
I agree too! But I think there's something to be said about building things up-- eg for me right now I'm not ready to go all-in even on VAB.TO, and PSA.TO could be a good fix.

But as time goes on, and my TFSA fills up, then it's time to sell off PSA.TO, and move it to either VAB.TO or towards long-term stock investments, and open up a HISA.

I guess you also have to think time-value of money -- how hard/time consuming is it for you to bounce between providers, vs invest with PSA.TO and take a 0.15% hit? (does PSA.TO get you the maximum amount -0.15%, or does it get a "high rate" -.15%? 'cause it looks like it's lower than EQ's 2.3% by quite a bit...)
I don't think it's a myth. I have a tonne of available credit, small balance of $200 on one card. I wanted to get the credit card associated with the company I work for partnered with a major bank. They sent me a letter saying my income doesn't support additional credit. Basically I have to close accounts or reduce credit limits for this bank to give me anything.
I get 3% for Gas or Groceries, I didn’t really think 7-11 would count as a groceries purchase to be honest.
I believe you can just apply the cashback savings to one of your purchases, should be fairly straightforward.  It's 1.75% cashback on everything else which is pretty good.
Charge cards do not affect utilization.
Is 6 months of expenses $30K?

Pay off you debts, and split into TFSA and RRSP since you are not in a high income yet. 

The CCP way is the way to go.
Well the 6k is just side income, I do have a full time job ontop of that. So don’t think it’d be beneficial but have to follow the law and file them.
Mmmm, love me some guns
Check your work insurance policy to see the details about earning income. They may or may not allow it (clawbacks).
Sell the truck and hope it covers the rest of the loan and get something different. That’s insane to be paying.
Credit utilization is measured as a whole
That's a good point about using it in a TFSA. Currently the best TFSA rate for a high interest savings account is Motus at 2.5%. I suppose you could argue that [PSA.TO](https://PSA.TO) would be appropriate for someone that has no interest in shuffling money around to the best rate year to year (ex Alterna's rate was 1.95% last year and now it's 2.35%). Personally, I think using your TFSA contribution room on a savings account is a waste of the best investment tool we have for long-term growth!
99.9% of the reason to move to Moncton comes from being able to buy a decent home for 160k on a lot bigger than a postage stamp. Why by near DT, one of the worst areas of Moncton, when you can get a nice home in Riverview with a yard. 

Anything in the St. George Street area is going to be a nightmare, it's where all the drugs, prostitution and crime happens. Either go a little more north or across the bridge. 

You're going to need a car here. It's really as simple as that. The bus system sucks and everything is decently far away. 

Air BnB is really hit or miss. You'll get a lot of business for weekend trips, sports related stuff, concerts etc but you won't get many week long rentals. Not worth it in my opinion. If you really want "passive" rental income. Look for a house with a apartment or suit. Much better and much more reliable. 

We made the move from BC to NB and absolutely love it here. Best of luck to you!
This is what we do. Save it up in our tfsa and then dump the $2500 January 1 every year.
It will help your score
A good portion of your credit score is paying your bills on time. No balance, no bill. No pay bill, no good boy points.
Well I'm on a mental health leave.
I'm stressed/ depressed have been given antidepressants and antianxiety since my leave.  I'm the caregiver of my terminal ill mom.

The hours of the call center are very different from my current job since we call people in different time zones. So it works out with still having someone with her since some of my shifts used to be as early as 6am for the call centre.

But I get it, it's a risk. I was just looking for a way to earn more money during this difficult time. I don't think I will take the risk. 

Thank you for your reply
Thank you.
> They often treat it as low priority because it is not a pressing medical issue.

And, not to put too fine a point on it, because they aren't paid to handle it.
In cold storage.
The yield is also lower, no?

I guess one advantage is you could do it within a TFSA, but... Why?

TBH though my emergency fund in my regular checking account "made me" $93 in interest last year... And the government's cut of that was technically 47% since it came after my salary.

So why? Why even bother with a HISA? How inflexible is something like VAB.TO in comparison that I'd be willing to take ~1% interest instead?

edit: ... but I'm guessing you can have a HISA in a TFSA right?
To which I'd just go to a different lender, if they don't want my money, someone else will. Again, just my opinion.

Edit: It seems reddit disagrees with my opinion, despite comments backing up said opinion. Typical reddit.
Monthly distributions! You should also weigh the cons of commissions for selling the ETF. If you're paying $4.99 + ECN fees to sell an ETF eventually to hold few hundred dollars of cash in your brokerage account, the break-even point will be a couple months of holding.
Moncton is pretty shit for concerts.

A lot of people who come to Moncton for the events you mentioned do so for a day trip, and even if every single one of them came for an airbnb you're talking about maybe 10 weekends a year that there are events.

Do you know what keeps hotels running in the maritimes? People travelling for business or sports teams, both of which would not use airbnb.

The maritimes holds smaller communities and the peak tourism season is the Summer, which has most people using camping based lodging.
When did her first clutch fail? I'm only on 20,000 kms.
If you are on medical leave, that should mean you can't work. If you can work, even sitting by the phone, can you do that at your current employer?

Of course your employer could find out. Well, their insurance company for sure, they'r sneezy little bastards.
A side question: why do you feel entitled to not pay a bill you owe?
Thanks for the information. I'm sorry to hear about your situation. My car only has 20,000 KM and most issues arise around 100,000 kms. I have a bad feeling about my car because I was driving a year ago and my car suddenly stopped switching gears. I barely made it up an average incline. One-hundred-ish dollars is hardly an adequate compensation when new issues are slowly accumulating. My car feels like it has a delayed input. A slight lag when I press the gas.
Assuming you have room, you could just use your tfsa.  But if not, yea HISA until next year.
Nobody cares about a measly $46.48.
Beside an unloaded Glock 17.
Actually according to the data on [this page](https://www.univcan.ca/universities/facts-and-stats/tuition-fees-by-university/) the average cost of tuition for a Canadian student in an arts/humanities program at an Ontario university was around $7000 for the 2018-19 academic year. The average drops to around $6600 if you ignore "Redeemer University College" in Hamilton, which is apparently a Christian liberal arts college and seems to have very high tuition.

&#x200B;

An RESP account which has maxed out the CESG to $7200 has, ignoring investment growth or losses, $43,200 in it.  That would appear to be enough to fund tuition, fees, and books for four academic years.
There should be an option to print it out.
As others have said, max out at least your TFSA first, as you will likely get better performance there (unless it's a big bank TFSA savings account), and those funds will be fairly liquid.

After that, it depends on how conservative you are. If you're cautious, you won't get much more than that and the "return" on paying down your mortgage is tax free.
I’ve been using Taxtron for about ten years. The software design is spectacularly poor, but it works (if you have a bit of patience). www.taxtron.ca
Yeah monthly dividend. This is what I use as well.
I would max out your RRSP before contributing to the Non-Reg. You’re not required to deduct the contributions in the year you make them, and can defer it to a later time when you’re in the higher tax bracket and it will be more beneficial. The fewer taxes you can pay on your investments the better off you’ll be. The two things you can control is the value you get from the cost you pay (notice I didn’t necessarily say lowest cost is best) and the amount of taxes on your investments.

As for investment advice, stick with the couch potato passive strategy and just leave it. Enjoy the ride and continue to contribute to it early and often (especially as markets are sliding). As long as you have a long-term horizon with this money, don’t worry about what the markets are doing today!
You have wrong info on what is average and pretty low aspirations for yourself
1. Yes

2. If you want to transfer a balance from another credit card onto your tangerine card.

3. Promotional rate for a balance transfer.

4. If you use the credit card to withdraw cash (instead of paying for stuff), you pay that fee + number 5 in interest. Quick word of advice: don’t do this!

5. Interest if you do what I explained in 4

6. I’m not quite sure either

7. Yes

8. If you want a new card in the mail rushed to you.
$10,000 in a TFSA. $3,000 mattress money. Just threw a small $1,000 “windfall” in a WealthSimple account but don’t really know what I’m doing there.
Thank you!
You can’t open up a TFSA for your son. He needs to be 18 or 19.
I went back to school around your age. I needed to figure life out and make the 'right' decision. Did I? I think it was okay. I took electronics engineering technology at a community college. Making decent money now.

Anyways, during those few years I had near min wage jobs so you are ahead of where I was at that time. Hopefully due to your lack of social life you were able to save some of that money!

I am in a trade, I like it. It's something to consider. You like working with you hands? Solving problems? Doing repetitive things? Maybe different locations but it can be monotonous.
It can be a good career. You can eventually get off the tools and get a managerial job in the company or lead hand.

This is a good time to really dig deep and explore yourself and your options. You are still very young. Don't feel like you are behind your peers in the career building stuff. You're good.

Its also good that you aren't addicted to the income. I've seen quite a few friends be happy making 40k a year and never go back to school but they would be much better of if they did. Leaving 85k would be tough but good for you for seeing the bad stuff with the job.

Good luck!
TIL you could ask your credit card company to change your billing date.
My wife and I have a son graduating with a Chemical Engineering degree this month, and a daughter half way through a bachelor's on her way to medicine, if things go ok.
If you think an RESP is a "FREE RIDE", man are you mistaken.
We maxed out our kid's RESP every year we were eligible, and while it helps out a lot, it does not cover everything.
Both our kids worked every summer to supplement their ability to pay for school.
If we could, we would have paid 100% of their schooling. They both graduated valedictorian and have never given us a moments trouble. But in hindsight, working probably added to their character.
In a safe *somewhere*
Landlord here.  Unless you are a sufficiently experienced landlord to know what you're getting into, do not attempt remote landlording.  You're basically proposing to commute to a worse-than-minimum-wage job with no fixed schedule.  There's so much of this that you can't do remotely.

You may be thinking 'property management'.  Terrible idea.  Their 10% of gross will almost certainly consume slightly more your profit on the rental revenue.  In exchange for that, they really do nothing except keep it rented and respond to tenant complaints; they have no incentive to rent to people who won't trash your house.

Downsize, rent, and invest the difference in an appropriately-conservative mix of index funds.  You will have a much more predictable outcome, at 1% of the stress and headaches.
I've got $500 in cash at the house for literal emergencies - ie. 4-day power failure where all ATMs go down.

$4000-5000 in my chequing account (Scotiabank) to keep their minimum before account fees and for fairly quick access.

The remainder is in my TDDI TFSA account where I am comfortable holding my emergency fund in a bond index.

I don't subscribe to the idea that I need to have my 3 months, perfectly liquid, ready to pay the kidnappers before midnight. The varying levels make it easy to get at the first 2 levels; the third level is available in the event of traditional emergencies such as job loss, large repair bills, etc.
Sorry. Yes tax software you install.
You mean tax software you install?  Confused by your wording.
You'd be surprised. Not much in terms or tourists, but this is the hub city so people are always looking for cheap places to stay for concerts, events, workshops etc. Think about all the people that come to town for stuff like the boat show or Atlantic Nationals.
Is there any benefits for having this card and a Chequing account from Tangerine? Is it possible to make payments instantly or do you still need to do bill payments to it and wait a few days to process?
Thanks. I will contact them on Tuesday because this weekend is a long weekend.
Wow great to know. I occasionally have cash sitting around in my Questrade accounts because I don’t have time to deal with it. How is the interest earned? Through dividends?
My Fiesta has an "S" gear. When I shift into the S gear, there is a button that I can use to shift gears up or down. I've always called it an Automatic Manual Transmission but my wording might be incorrect. A common problem is a grinding sound if the software, chip, or hardware system is messing up. I think Ford had integrated the S gear into trucks too.
When talking trades make sure advice comes with location and type of trade work such as millwright working in plant in B.C.
My parents paid for my tuition and books. It was up to me if I wanted to stay at home (rent free) or incur the cost of going elsewhere for school. It was great knowing that my parents had covered the main part of my schooling and it made it possible for me to choose to go to school further away if I wanted and only have those costs to worry about.

I ended up moving a couple hours away for school and it was really the best choice I ever made. It pushed me to apply for a bunch of scholarships so my first year of residence and food was totally covered. Then I got to learn some adult skills finding a place to rent with friends, live with roommates, and learn to grocery shop and cook on a fairly tight budget (especially if I wanted money left for drinks and going out!). My parents were very supportive but from the start they made it pretty clear not to expect any additional funds aside from tuition and books. Don't get me wrong there was a learning curve! Despite having room and board covered by scholarships first year, I still spent my summer savings plus OSAP money wastefully on things like bars and eating out. That changed right quick when money was tighter second year. I'm happy that I was able to learn from it pretty quickly!

Between OSAP and working in the summer (and during school in my 4th year) I was able to cover my costs and graduate from the school of my choice (b/c I didn't feel 'stuck at home), with minimal debt, a degree, and a bunch of skills and experiences that friends that stayed at home lacked.  

My partner and I plan to try and max our child's RESP account, and do something similar to what my parents did. I don't want our child to feel like they have to live at home because the cost of school is too great.
Do you prefer it show up as gas or groceries?

&#x200B;

I mainly use Cobalt for the 5X points on groceries, so I prefer the purchase show up as groceries.
Another option may be to immediately sell your current property, buy a property in the interior that is of 60%-70% value of your current property, rent that out and rent yourself until you’re ready to retire in 5 years.
Trade school is generally a good option, lots of ways you could go there. 

Ever think of EMS or firefighting? EMS has decent career options and it's actually a pretty fun job. Firefighting is very competitive to get a job in the city, but if you do you're set for life. Both require minimal schooling, are well respected, and pay quite well (at least in Alberta)
They may ask you to cancel a credit card or LoC before they'll extend a loan.
Not if you only use them for welcome bonuses. I have 10 open cards right now, but by year end the only ones remaining will be my core 3 cards (+ whatever new cards I will have gotten for bonuses).

You get a card, put all of my normal spending on it until I receive the welcome bonus, stick in the drawer, mark on the calendar when to cancel it, rinse and repeat. 

You are right though it’s easy to get spread out if you don’t coordinate the different points programmes. But if you do it right it can really pay off, for example I just booked a $900 plane ticket with some points and only paid $140 in tax/fees. Check out r/churningcanada if you’re interested in this kind of stuff!
This completely contrasts what a emergency fund is.
Cibc still pre approves my credit limit by like 3000 every 6 months. All I do is just call in to accept.
 

Interest on Purchases: 19.95% **(I am assuming this is for overdue payments?)**

Balance transfer fee: 3.00% of the amount transferred, or minimum of $5.00 **(What is this?)**

Promotional Balance transfer interest rate\*: 1.95% interest for the first 6 months (19.95% after that) **(What is this?)**

Cash advance: $3.50 within Canada, $5.00 outside Canada **(everytime I withdraw money from the card I pay this fee plus the interest below?)**

Interest on Cash Advances:19.95%

Dishonoured payment: $25.00 **(no idea what this is)**

Over-Limit: $25.00 **(If i spend over the card limit?)**

Rush Card: $25.00 **(What is this?)**
this is some level 20 galaxy brain shit 

\>pay the $50

&#x200B;

\>pay it 3 months late

&#x200B;

\>deny that its your debt for a year

&#x200B;

\>ignore it completely, let it drain your credit score
This. If your TFSA and RRSP are full and it's a question of non-reg investing or paying down mortgage quicker, then maybe you could consider paying down mortgage.
Home Trust gives you 2.5% savings by having no Forex fee, 1% cashback that you get back on your statement at the beginning of the year, so you get 3.5% which makes it quite similar. How is the Rogers World Elite card for actually getting your money back? I got a Platinum card a while back that I never used and cancelled, it seemed to be not worth the hassle to call a Customer Service agent to manually receive a cashback.
Think about it: they don’t want you to redeem, they want you to think you get something so you keep using their product, inclusive of service fees and interest, and never cost them anything.

If you want to benefit, don’t spread your use across three to five cards.
oh yeah. fuck yeah. Are you really willing to ruin your credit here? it's $50 just skip a night out and pay it.
TFSA because I have so much available space in there, I don't want to move it to HISA yet
I have a 7 month old daughter right now. If I have to eat hot dogs and drink hot dog water every day for the rest of my life to afford to max out the RESP for my daughter, so be it. My parents could barely afford food on the table and I didn't learn the importance of a higher education. I want the best for my daughter and I believe that means a higher education.
Yeah if we are taking 1-3 years I can see the use in a GIC.
I have the same setup, my Home Trust Visa is my international currency/travel card, my PC GE MasterCard is my Canada card.  I'm debating getting the Scotiabank Passport Visa but I'm not sure whether the yearly fee is worth the lounge access as I'm not traveling a lot this year.
In 2007 they were!   I forget when they cut it...
I’m actually renting it out as I’ve had to move for work.   I get 900 a month for it.
this is some galaxy brain shit
Yup....

You need shelter, not property ownership!
What terms are you questioning?
I dont know if an airbnb in Moncton is going to be very lucrative...
See, that's how it stabilizes. Whoever does end up with property wants none of that, and there's always enough to keep that at bay.
Interesting article by the Guardian from a few months ago that compared wind/oil


What if Canada had spent $200bn on wind energy instead of oil?

Toronto does have a history of crashes requiring decades to recover. That's never happened in Vancouver though.
I've heard of this, but honestly I think it's a bit of a myth.

I think of it this way: If you have a good credit history (and history of paying off your debts) why would they pass up extending you credit? If you pay it off right away they don't really lose anything, they just earn less in interest.

Show me a bank that will pass up giving you an auto loan because you're "too good" at paying off your debts? It makes you lower risk, and higher likelihood of receiving credit in my opinion.
Look into Rogers World Elite, 4% off forex and the usual coverage benefits.
Finishing my university degree this year and my parents paid for my tuition all throughout. However, I attended a university in a different city and I was responsible for all the associated expenses (food, rent, etc.), so I worked 2 jobs every summer for that. Honestly, a 'free-ride' does so much for university students when it comes to pursuing what they want. In the case of students pursuing a job in the medical or healthcare field, not having to work opens up time for important CV/Application builders like research or volunteering. It also enables students to study for the important tests that are required for their career choice (MCAT, PCAT, LSAT, etc.), that could be put aside if the student needs to work excessive hours to support themselves. In terms of mental health, not having to stress about looming financial burdens when pursuing one's career, or having to juggle being a full-time student and worker has a significant and understated effect. For instance, I think that having that financial + time freedom to pursue important 'things' overall has a strong effect on their self-worth and what they end up valuing of their degree because when you're pitted into that university environment it can really bring what you value of yourself down. At least in my experience, when you compare university students that have significant financial privileges in comparison to those without, there's a real difference in what they're able to do during their degree that enables them to better pursue a career. So yes, I think that giving your child that 'free ride' can be a really big help.

&#x200B;

That being said, the maturity of the student is imperative as well and as others have mentioned, instilling it during high school is an important thing. Ensure that whatever your child chooses, they have a thought-out road-map (Volunteering this year, doing research then, etc.) and at least a foundation of skills (Self-monitoring/esteem/control etc.) to succeed.
I'm using the same as you for 1 and 2.  I don't travel right now so don't need 3 lol...
As others have already noted, having a high amount of unused credit is a good thing for your credit rating. But I’ve been told there is a trade off eventually if the amount of available credit you have starts to significantly exceed your income.
Why not just pay it off? It seems silly not paying off $50, since your credit score will suffers heavily if your bill get sent to collection agencies. What if you are planning on applying for mortgage, car loan, or even line of credit?
Your money will be locked in Questrade for two business days, you can't get the money out outside of market hours, and the fund manager subtracts a 0.15% annual fee to simply shuffle your money around to different savings accounts with a good return. It makes no sense to use this as an alternative to a real HISA. The only function that is logical is holding cash in a brokerage that you don't want to deploy yet.
You can however double down and HELOC the money out and invest it. It can make a bad situation worse or stem the bleeding and make things better. Depends on risk tolerance.
It has been at 2.8% for a while. But since it's not a GIC, rates are subject to change at anytime.
To each their own but I would first max your registered accounts (TFSA+RRSP) as they will likely have better returns for your $.
the CT in my town is pretty good too, haven't been anywhere else and they have been very professional as well
That has none of the attributes of an emergency fund. OP didn't say "where can I park cash for investing?"- transferring your money out takes days and it would be difficult to initiate selling outside of market hours.
I have half in my HISA. The other half is cash in a safe.
It's called MY HELOC haha 😔 😢
It's not.

WealthSimple savings account at 2% interest, topping up every year in case the 2% interest doesn't cover inflation.
This is not true.

I just switched to the PC Financial Mastercard, and am going through my previous cards statements to ensure I switch all the "set it and forget it" stuff I had on the old card. Things like Netflix, CAA, Dollar Shave Club, etc.

In addition to the 20,000 point bonus on our first purchase at any Loblaws stores, we've already accumulated an additional 11,000 points in just the first week or so.

My old card is with my credit union, and while I've enjoyed plenty of rewards over the years, they just recently switched points programs and I feel it's more difficult to earn points now.

So I'm working to finish paying off the balance on my old card (I know, I know), and using my new PC Financial card for all everyday purchases & paying it off biweekly.
Yeah, it was great before the website change. Now, it's really difficult to get the information. I can't believe they went online with that...
This was the case for me when I purchased my first home. The bank asked me to lower the limits on my cards, despite having $0 balances. They said I had to much available credit. This was 10 years ago when credit card companies raised your limit without asking you.
The oil and gas industry will never boom like it did before.  

It's not currently in a bust. Not a boom, but not a bust as well. Production is fairly high. With new technology the company will be able to capture a lot more of the next  boom through automation. 

Sorry
I feel for you -  PC financial won't help. I had a similar issue and plan to get rid of the card because of the awful customer service. They have really gone downhill
I have probably averaged more than this in the past few years. Road bike, skis, ski boots, climbing gear, suits/professionalish clothing. Probably have averaged closer to $3-4K on this in previous years, but now I have the stuff I want and don't need to spend a lot to sustain those purchases.
Diversified economy?
Sure it is. Maxing out an resp is $2500 plus $500 grant. That's $3000 invested annually for 18 years. If you could get 3% return on that, that is $70,000.

That's pretty much a free ride if you put at least a bit of effort into controlling costs.
Yes they are sending someone to do an appraisal, everything is included in the $150 setup fee.
Prepayment is garunteed 3.59% ROI. Investing has inherent risk but you could access the cash in an emergency, personally I would invest but having your home paid off early is a huge burden to be rid of. Only you can decide what is best for you.
Perfect! Thanks didn’t know if I could do my taxes without registering for GST.
Yes
Pre-payments make the most impact early in the mortgage, so definitely keep doing the pre-payments. You couuld do a lump sum too if you have the cash to spare however there is usually a maximum amount you're allowed to pay each year and there are fees involved if you exceed it.
>Does bills sent to collection damage my credit score?

Yes.
What happened? Were you trying to sell when no one was buying? Or did you buy when it was near 20k?
Hmm, I disagree, if it’s listed as commission, then you are automatically qualify to deduct expenses to earn these income.

The T2200 is required if you want to claim expenses that are beyond the $2,200 or that you don’t have commission income (e.g. just regular salary) but under the employment contract you are required to pay some expenses personally to earn these income, such as automobile, home office, tools, etc
141,000 people moved to the GTA last year, the most ever recorded in a single year IIRC. A city the size of Peterborough is moving to the GTA every year. It’s crazy.
Depends if you plan on getting future credit from a bank in the next 4-7 years. All over $50.
That’s exactly what’s happened over the last 2 years - prices in Toronto dropped about 10% in 2017 and have remained more or less flat since.
I recommend trying out programming to anyone looking for a career path with good job prospects. Do a computer science or software engineering degree that has a coop program. Once you graduate, there are a lot of jobs that pay well. Outside of gaming expect a minimum starting salary of 65k, up to low 6 figures depending on how much time you invested in your skills.
Great! Thank you.
Do you really spend $1500 on clothes/sporting goods a year?
Software development. Teach yourself.
Jesus Christ. Almost $1100 a month for a work truck. You owe $55k and you're halfway through your term? So the purchase price of your truck was $110k with $0 down? At $120k-$130k a year, I think you need to seriously re-evaluate where your money is going. Even with the absurd loan payment, you shouldn't be struggling. 

If I were you, I'd cut my losses and sell it immediately. Then sit down at do some serious budgeting.
Get a cheaper vehicle maybe....
The best time to buy is today....you don't know what will happen, and if you do...please tell us.
GST and taxes are separate.

Yes you don't have to register for it.
Don't put more than $36k in an RESP, there's no real benefit.

$2,500 per year for 14 years, then $1,000 in the 15th year. That's your $36,000 contributions for maximum CESG of $7,200.
I agree. We bought our house because it's our dream dwelling and we plan to be here until we die. It ticked all the boxes on our list for where/how we want to live. I don't even consider the monetary value of it now. One day it will be paid off, and if we actually have to sell it before we die for health reasons, I don't really care if it sells for less than I paid. I don't consider it part of my retirement savings.
Are you me?
Finance is a grind usually at low salaries for several years, unless you can skip the first 7 levels of finance job grades, you wouldn't be any happier.
No, I’ve spent plenty of time in Edmonton. All different seasons, I can make my own judgement. 

I was responding to a post
This is my plan as well. Keep contributing and building it, but just not let them fully know how much is in there. At least let them work as well to build into it.
I disagree that having a higher credit limit will hurt your debt worthiness, assuming you aren’t increasing your spending along with the limit increase.  Nowadays it is generally agreed upon that additional unused credit only improves your credit utilization rate and overall had a positive impact on your score.

Maybe it was true at one point that having high credit available could reduce debt worthiness, but this simply isn’t the case in the current models being used.

Just spend responsibly and keep taking the increases as they come.
I think your plan makes sense, but it’s not a slam dunk and there are a lot of details to consider.  If you have more house than you need right now and can save substantially by renting then it may be worthwhile.  Of course there are transaction costs that you will have to cover when selling and buying, and the rent itself will be spent over 5 years.  But if you only have $125k equity in the home, then a lot of the $3200 is going toward interest anyway.  Plus owning the home is hiring risk, incurs maintenance costs, and higher insurance, utilities, etc then a smaller rental will.  

The new home in the interior - what price range are you considering and how much would it rent for?  Will you be cash flow positive, even accounting for maintenance, unoccupied periods (say it’s rented only 10/12 months on average), etc?  

More importantly are you ready to be a remote landlord for this property, and be driving back and forth a lot, or will you hire a property manager to help run the place, and pay the property manager a significant portion of your income to do so?  

Side point - you have $750k invested, how do you figure that will generate $60k investment income per year?  If you haven’t already, I suggest reading the Trinity Study and learn about the 4% rule, which would indicate a safe withdrawal rate from your curren portfolio is $30k per year, so you would have to get $1.5M invested to safely withdraw $60k annually.
You sound like a real estate agent.
Why not put it in a high interest savings account like eq bank. Something like 2.3% return
Concise and to the point. Thanks.
Ah ok....so it looks like the max is 50k/beneficiary. I can't open up a TFSA for my son though so I'd like to keep putting the money he's getting from the gov't into the RESP. Might just hoard it in a HISA for the remainder of this year and then dump it Jan 01/20 so he gets the full benefit.

Bye Felicia.
In my TFSA, invested in VEQT.
>It might take 15-20 years to make up the money you lost, but if you are happier in life that's more important than missing out on a few bucks.

THIS. I would even say "even if you don't catch up with the salary"
You are limited each year to $500 of CESG.  You may contribute more in order to have it grow within that account, but you will receive no grant for it this year, or in future years without contributing more in those future years.
Why not just skip the part about buying another house right now, and just rent until you are ready to move?  No need for all of the unnecessary headaches associated with being a landlord.  Just make sure you save enough money for your downpayment when the time comes.
100% get all documentation from doctors etc and then go to at the accountant for disability appeal.  It will cost about $400-500 to get it done but the return from the application of the disability credit will be significant to cover all accounting expenses
3 months worth expenses in a HISA, and then 3 months expenses in 3 funds with different levels of risk. 

The idea is to draw out whichever has most value when it’s needed. A bit of market timing but I’m comfortable with it.
Writing it on May 2nd.
Check out the link posted below for a better idea of what’s gonna be on there.

Same risk.  I just like it so I can access my money on questrade instantly to buy something I like on a dip.
> How does this affect my credit score? 

One should only worry about credit score if planning on buying a house or car in the next 2-5 years. If not, whatever.
The only way to avoid US dividend withholding is to jold the stocks in the RRSP. 

But that really depends on what OP wants to do with the investment in the first place.
THIS. I hope more people could read this and stop blaming imaginary actors for their problems. But, hey, what's the fun in it, right?
If that's the case then you're not doing it right, and should probably stick to a cashback card. I've managed to accumulate about 130K Amex points on my Cobalt card in about 15 months. That's an actually usable amount; plus I managed to do that while still racking up Avion points that I eventually transferred to WestJet dollars during a conversion bonus promo.
I keep it in EQ Bank's HISA 2.3%
I attended UofT from 2007-2011 entirely on grants, OSAP, and working through the summers.  I had some money saved up from my part time job in high school but the amount is pretty much negligible. 

I lived at Innis Residence, for which meal plans were optional -  so I saved quite a bit of money fromYour submission to r/datascience has been removed.

>Post-boom DSs: "You should major in data science, because if you want to be a data scientist why would you spend time learning non-data science things that you may never use?".

I think it may go this way. It's always hard to predict the future, so I can't really state it with confidence. But, there is a precedent to new academic disciplines in STEM emerging.

There used to be a time when computer science was not a separate academic discipline, but was housed under mathematics departments, or electrical engineering departments, and really emerged around WWII with Turing.

Even statistics departments are relatively new, with the first of them being established around the time of World War I ([Source](https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ss/1177013002)), and most of them established in the past 50-60 years ([Source](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-3649-2_1)). If I recall correctly, the first statistics departments were actually biostatistics departments. JHU is one of the oldest statistics departments, as is Cornell's, which is why it still retains the major called "Biometry and Statistics." Cornell's "Statistical Science" dept was created in 2005. Even at Harvard, their biostatistics dept predate their statistics department considerably.

So "statistics" as an academic discipline in its own right is rather recent in the grand scheme of things.

Everyone here obviously knows that both CS and Statistics are grounded in mathematics and are direct descendants of math. I feel that data science as a distinct academic discpline could be emerging as well. But I think it's still too early to tell.
How does it deals with credentials?
Ah, the GCE bit is what I missed. Thanks!
Once you set a schedule, it runs on a Google Cloud Compute Engine. Not locally. So that machine will always be connected to the net.
This is great! Thank you so much!!
This seems incredible, I’ll probably fool around with it.
ns of tax credits and benefits. It's always good to file a tax return, even if you made $0 that year. Because it makes you eligible for low income tax credits and such.
It was a better time to buy 3 months ago when pessimism was much more dramatic. Today though, is the next best time.
I keep mine in Motive Financial. 2.8%.
> you may claim expenses that you have incurred to earn this $2,201.79

True, but only if OP receives a form T2200 signed by their employer stating that they can claim their commission expenses.
You can call in and have the card changed to one with no fee
I think you can, you just won’t get any gov money past the $2500, so there isn’t much point to put it in the resp, another savings vehicle would be better, like tfsa.
Super dreading the possibilitiy of $2.50/L gas in the lower mainland of BC soon.
Lol tell your premier to give us in BC some oil, we'll take it! Gas at 1.70+/liter uugh. 

On the flip side, people are scared to buy real estate in down markets, so if you are a savvy investor with a long time horizon and buy a quality cash flow property, there is still good to be found in a market like Edmonton.
Just checked my Scotia Visa statement, it's still counting them as gas purchases despite listing as 7-11. Should be all good.
what neighbourhood is this in?
a little late to the party...

im 25. 85k pretax. Toronto. probably will make 95k pretax in 3 years.

because ive maxed TFSA, im planning on starting to contribute to RRSP now. 

does that sound good? or should i keep it in a HISA until I make 95k+?

thanks,
yea i was holding out that time too when i saw it dropping i was scared and didint know how low it would go but i didint expect it to rebound so much in such a short period of time now it feels like im fomoing in and buying at the top during very volatile times...
You already have a mortgage broker, why not just call them ;)
Oh yeah then you will be taxed and you will need to report it. Imagine if people were paid by different clients every time and they were given less than 11k, they would pay no tax. You need to pay the tax relative to your total income.
Everyone saying HISA - could you specify with whom you hold the account? I’m looking around for options with >2% interest that offer joint accounts.
We set enough aside in RESPs and savings for both our kids to cover about 2 years' worth of school each.  They're responsible for making up the rest, through work, scholarships, and/or loans/grants/bursaries.  We made sure both knew this before starting post-secondary so they could prepare.

Our oldest convocates in June.  They made up their share of funding through a couple of scholarships and full-time work every summer.  They'll graduate with no debt.  We helped out with some living expenses (PC Optimum for groceries, travel).  Our youngest starts in September, and we will see what will happen with them.
In addition to credit utilization, your credit worthiness is also somewhat based on how much you have access to. The credit bureaus also assess risk as “if this guy decided to max out everything at once, how much would it be?” and that number shouldn’t be ridiculously high if you don’t need it to be.

Also a factor is, when you go to get a loan for something else like a car, for example, they may say, well you’ve got $15,000 in open credit here, this car is $25,000, so if you ended up maxing the $15,000 during this car loan, your income doesn’t support $40,000 debt repayment, so you could be declined the loan.

If you don’t need that increase, I’d avoid it.

Edit: clarified a point.
How does this work? Is it higher risk than a HISA?
First of all, I am so sorry for what you are going through. I'm around your age (just finished my undergrad), and my mother is also terminally ill, so I know how tough it is.

Eighteen is old enough to be able to do most things possible with your money. In your situation I would absolutely recommend you work with a fee-only financial planner (a good list of them is [here](http://www.valueofsimple.ca/links/directory-of-fee-only-planners/)). They will work with you to clarify your financial needs/goals, and walk you through how to manage the money you do have now and will have in the future. I would avoid financial advisors at the big banks like TD or BMO, as they will probably pressure you into putting your money in mutual funds which will likely not be your best option. I also hope your family has access to a good estate lawyer who will clarify how the estate should be settled.

Finally, investments like bitcoin and real estate may be more risky than you think. [Here](https://canadiancouchpotato.com/2018/01/16/podcast-14-make-millions-in-bitcoin-not-really/) is a good analysis of bitcoin, and [here](https://canadiancouchpotato.com/2018/06/16/podcast-17-keeping-it-real-with-ben-rabidoux/) the same author discusses real estate as an investment vehicle. While my recommendation is absolutely to talk with a financial planner before adopting any long-term strategy, my guess is that they will probably recommend options beyond those two.
In that case you will be taxed on it. All income should be combined.


Edit: Wait, do you receive GST/HST from Uber for your trips? This link makes it appear like they always provide these funds to the driver.  In which case you would need to pay back these amounts: https://www.uber.com/en-CA/drive/resources/canada-sales-tax/
Doesn’t matter when your friends are making minimum wage or struggling thru school

You will see each year that goes by your going to see less of these people as more and more get involved in more serious relationships
Or jobs .  

Go on nice holidays if you get any time off at your job. Long weekends get up and go

That’s the best way to treat these jobs if you work lots of overtime and night shifts make the best of your days off
Not possible to move
Union labour, no upward mobility. Managers make the same/similar anyways lol.
My wife and I were talking/crying just last night about how much further ahead I was at 23 than I am now at 33. Finally getting back on track after being a single income household for the last ten years. 

YOU ARE NOT ALONE.
Amazing, thanks for this!

Is that a promo rate?
I bet your work has a need for an electrician or other ticketed trades

Those are money positions at a workplace like yours
Intend to max and pay for everything. Tbh, I don’t think a maxed out RESP will pay for a bachelors in 18 years though (assuming the max contribution and grant amounts are not adjusted).

It’ll serve more to lessen the load on our incomes than as a means to pay for it.

I don’t believe working minimum wage jobs while trying to pursue a degree is working for it. It’s a necessity that people try to sell as a positive character building trait that ultimately results in less than optimal performance.

I don’t think making a child pay for their schooling is going to magically make them work hard. That’s a character trait that you have 18 years to give them, ain’t no magic bullet going to make them suddenly work hard.

I would restrict the degrees I’d use the RESP on though. I’m surprised this is actually up for debate. My parents are business people, they sat me down and went through different outcomes, financial and work-life balance related for different degrees, chances of success, unemployment rates etc. That’s literally a parents job at that point, being a wise advisor.
No problem 
It doesn't appear OP has purchased yet anyways
It takes years to get exactly what you want, but it's not true if you just want a "government job that makes more than 50k"
You should go to trade school if you want something different.  Millwright would be good as you get to solve problems and work with tools. 

No matter what you do you'll be taking a pay cut initially, but at least with trade school you can probably get into one with a co-op program so you can make money during your co-op. 

When you finish you'll probably make less than you do now but eventually you'll make more.  

It might take 15-20 years to make up the money you lost, but if you are happier in life that's more important than missing out on a few bucks.
LoL Good God no....unless you hate that relative. Give them $500 and it'll cost you that much to get rid of them from your life. 

OR

You have WAY too much money then you know what to do with....

Tell the relative you can't use the cash because something came up and you need the cash immediately and can't wait a year for the payback. 

What if his cash flow doesn't get better within the year and he doesn't have enough to pay you back? Then it's another year....then another....and another....and then everyone walks away with feelings hurt. No.
Thanks for the opinions. It's highly doubtful I'll lend it.
Is your job simply manual or are you working in a management position? If the latter, moving into management positions in different companies could be fairly lucrative. You could also start your own business if you have an interest in something specific, maybe something related to the industry you're already in that could solve a problem you've seen in your work so far?
I never said the crew removing it verifies it, I said there are two in the room when they verify deposits. When the envelopes were opened off-site, there were always 2 people in the room verifying.

If you put $1,000 deposit but only deposited $100 into the envelope, your account was debited $900 as a keystroke error. If you deposited $1,000 and your envelope was empty, well, you were debited $1,000 for empty envelope.

Like I said, things may have changed, but that's how it apparently worked when I was at the bank. Not worth arguing about.
Also, don't forget "diversify your investments".
With the Canadian inflation rate sitting at 1.9% in march... you want to make sure that your emergency money that will be "sitting around" for that rainy day sits above inflation. Any HISA that offers 2% and higher will be the way go. Let that money collect interest and not lose value.
I bought about a 40k worth for my TFSA back in November as a long term investment after having it in a HISA for ages.  Figured I'd bite the bullet instead of procrastinating trying to time the market. Then of course as you mention it dipped quite a bit in December.  Instead of beating myself I just left it as is and it's now up 9.0% YTD.  Would have been nice to buy at the low but I didn't have the crystal ball back when I invested in November.  Time in the market > Timing the market.
A lot of you guys are talking about supply/demand economics, home ownership, valuation of assets, etc. Etc. What I'm about to say has less to do with the housing market and more to do with relying on oil in today's economy 

I hate to be the guy that chimes in here with this comment but I *seriously* doubt any political or economical moves on the national or provincial scale will affect the current devaluation of oil.

Oil is a limited commodity, which has proven to become only more difficult to harvest as we consume more of it. Eventually alternative energy sources will become cheaper.

Wishing for oil to bounce back is not a winning strategy, imho
Thanks! On registering for a GST it says if you do not exceed the $30,000 thresholdFootnote  1 over 4 consecutive calendar quarters. You do not have to register. You may choose to register voluntarily.

&#x200B;

So in my case I can do my taxes without a GST number but still have to do the T2125 for my uber income?
We are/have maxed the RESP for kiddo at age 5 (just debating lump suming the resf which forgoes $500 grant v. $2500 a year plus $500 grant).

I was in the privileged position to have my 4 year uni degree and accommodations paid for. I did get scholarship though which minimized tuition. My husband who did a couple different college programs also had his paid for. We will do the same for kiddo. Gives him a leg up in the world not having to deal with loans and such. Not sure what the future will hold, be it the trades, college or university or something else. The money will be there though. He will still have to work summers and during school year if he wants. He will have to pay for the wants and we will help provide the needs.

I think those of us who are in a privileged economic situation are not oblivious to it and are very much able to instill the value of money.
Motive Savvy Savings Account, 2.8%
In a few places. Some in stocks (TFSA trading account), some in a super-quick access Savings account, and some in a no-penalty GIC juuuust in case I need more.
This will only help you, lower credit utilization will improve, not worsen, your credit score.
Wow didn't know it was that strict, thought there was a threshold ie. if you make less than $10k you don't need to report.
I have another full time job, I do uber on the side. In total it amounts to over $11k for sure but just Uber is less than $6k.
Because this wouldn’t be your sole source of income (and I’m assuming not so much of an increase that it would be like 80% of your income or anything like that), you wouldn’t be a dependent contractor, so they won’t owe you anything when the contract expires.
From a tax perspective, because of our system being tiered, you’ll only pay the higher tax rate on the amount above that tax bracket threshold. You may want to ask them to build in medical or dental or something else as a negotiating tactic.
With my passport
There is no "way behind".. don't worry. Saving for retirement starts with $1 the day you decide it's important enough to take that dollar out of your monthly spending. Starting today is better than tomorrow!

&#x200B;

Start reading and get yourselves educated before you change anything. Reading the books in the wiki or mentioned in this thread is a good place to start. You also need to start setting aside a small chunk (10%) from your paycheques each month so you get used to that money being gone and once you are comfortable with a certain plan and determine how much you can afford to save and make it happen!
Don't quite know your answer, but I go to 7-11 sometimes and even the ones without gas show up as gas stations for my alerts.
Real Estate is now larger in BC than oil peaked at in AB.
I use 3 cards - 2 cashback and 1 travel

1- Scotia visa - 4% Cashback on Gas, grocery and pharmacy store purchase

2- Rogers mastercard - cashback on everything 1.75% ( for everything else that no.1 does not cover) 

3- Travel from TD - 3% back on all travel ( hotel and flight ) purchases. Comes as points but redeemable for travel and othter stuff... But best to use for points for travel as it equates to 3% cashback. Only downside is that you have to go through expediafortd. 

&#x200B;

Hope this helps

&#x200B;

PS: There are few cards that give features of no.1
HISA
That doesn't disprove what I said. You just stated your own salary. By the way, most governments jobs are in an office and not hands on labour or trades.
Psa.to
You are getting good advice here. I would just add that you need to alert the doctor (and his staff) as to the importance of any documentation that they receive. They often treat it as low priority because it is not a pressing medical issue. Get agreement that any action to be taken will be covered by site visits so the time can be compensated. Failing that, agree to pay for any administrative time spent on your file.

If a letter has been misplaced, get them to request a copy from  the CRA and make sure you review it with your doctor. Good luck.
You've added in assumptions
Thanks for clarifying! Thought there were different types of extended credit but wasn’t sure which products fell where. 

Where would a charge card (Amex) fall?
I see, so there's indeed a potential downside then. Not having room to actually get the credit I might actually need.
Most cards I get pool miles & points into a few external accounts – Aeroplan, Marriott Bonvoy and Alaska Airlines – and so often that they increase fast enough and never expire.

It would be a different story for programs that are harder to earn with, let alone redeem (Air Miles, personally speaking since others have had great success with that program).
If you sell the townhouse and buy another place in Edmonton, it’s basically the same. Selling and buying in a down market. It’ll only affect you if you move cities.
No appraisal or legal fees?
Is it really the accountants fault?  I agree that he should have said something, but the tax payers would have been provided an NOA that states exactly what their RRSP contribution room is.   

If the accountant really has 10,000 clients he is not providing any advice, but simply preparing returns.
Yeah that's the main reason why I have several cards I dont use. I've been accumulating them through the years as I migrate usage to the one with the cashback categories that adjust better to my consumption patterns. 

I have set alerts on all the cards both on usage and monthly balance to make sure that I get to see they are all zero.
EQ Bank 2.3% HISA, or one of the promotional HISA's if there are any at the time. Any HISA above 2% is fine though. If it's below 2%, change banks. There are better options.
Where in Western Canada?  Houses are not $750k in a lot of places.  Can you transfer to other locations?
I had one but I invested it once I realized I didn’t need one.
If you make less than 11k, you generally don't have to pay any taxes (federally anyway). Key word is pay. You still have to claim all of your income no matter what. Legally, if you mowed your neighbours lawn at 14 years old and he have you $7, you must report it or you are breaking the law.
You mean the same stuff that has been happening off and on for the last twenty years,
Bid and ask spread vs. last price
Not talking about churning I'm saying if you spread 10-15k in credit card spending across 3-5 cards how do you ever accumulate enough points balance to redeem
HISA.
It's not the effort it's if you're not spending 10k on one card a year or more it takes forever to ever get a flight
It was definitely over 40 degrees in my dorm room all summer. But that was near the top of a 12 storey cement high rise with no AC.

I just assumed it was about as hot outside.

And the minus 40 was counting windchill, which is a pretty regular thing at least in the early 2000s.
Losing a grand in the big crypto crash of 2017 was some of the best money I ever spent to teach me the worth of not trying to time the market.
This guy markets
totally! all those extra envelopes are so wasteful, anyway
If u make 85k a year id stick to it for another 10 years thats a shit ton of money its not worth taking lower money everyone needs to work and you get paid double the average. Dont leave can i get in there lmao
I never put cash into the atm for this very reason. Hopefully they can access the video footage. they probably have someone dishonest emptying the bank machine.
You need to report it, but from my understanding, you will probably not owe taxes if you made less than the Basic Personal amount which is $11, 809. (This is federal level, and you may owe taxes to your Province if somehow your basic personal amount for the province is lower than 6k)
I don't have any stake in the Vancouver real estate game, Im just saying what people who I know to be smart and I know to have unique knowledge about the situation are saying.

But they could be wrong. One of them tried to tell me that carl weathers was not in happy Gilmore, so they don't know everthing.
I legit applied for the lowest tier government job (roads labourer) and I make 60k. What are you on about?
Yeah, you are right. Im just saying, in my experience, in my area of northern Canada, the climate change (and maybe that's the wrong word, because im not neccesarily referring to man made climate change, but to just the variations I have personally seen over my life)  I have seen is actually the summers getting cooler and wetter and the winters getting warmer and drier.  I only had to shovel 3 times this past winter for example, but a decade ago I shoveled twice a week on average.

&#x200B;

Im just curious if this is localized just to northern bc or did it effect alberta too.
Yes, this is on the multimillion dollar homes, the big mansions that sit empty with nobody living in them because they are simple an investment for foreign nationals.
When do you plan to spend the money?  If not for 25 or 30 years you should consider that  if you invest on the best day in the next year or on the worst day in the next year [your 25 year returns](https://portfoliocharts.com/portfolio/three-fund-portfolio-can/) are not going to be radically different.

So if this is a once in a lifetime purchase you could dribble it in over maybe the next 6  months but if you are planning to invest regular amounts for many years to come you might as well get started.  Some of purchases will earn the best ever 25 year returns and some will earn the worst ever 25 year returns and they will average out to give you pretty average returns.
Yes further dropping, over the next few years and china tightens up its grasp on its billionaires trying to get money out of the country.
Not if you spend as much as my household does...
Good on you if you have had good experience there but in general Canadian Tire as been known to have some of the worst auto-mechanics, bad customer services and higher price than they're worth. That said, it's not impossible that the one you go to has good service.
Sold my youth for it though... try a social life when you start work at 11PM...
No, as I said in my comment, Im not smart, but I have friends and  family members who are heads of departments and deans of engineering etc in Canadian universities with 30k plus students. These are smart people with phds and masters degrees and decades of experience living and working in Canada and china, and this is the shit they tell me when I visit at Christmas.
No such rule, you have to report the income.  The downfall is CRA not only charging you the tax but penalties for lying to them. 

For HST/GST info: [https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses.html)

For the Uber income, you use form T2125. Your income and expenses go there. For your vehicle expenses, you have to track every km in a log that details personal and work related kms driven. The portion for Uber is the portion of the expenses you can claim (IE: 10% was for Uber so 10% of total expenses)
Hahah sorry about the pm then!
We have enough income to qualify for anything, I just remember initially some cards we applied for when we first landed didn't go through because they wanted someone with only foreign credit history to have a couple years of Canadian taxes filed (regardless of income). Putting down a GIC solved that and I haven't been on top of it with other priorities lately. I'll add Rogers to my research list, thanks.
HISA.
HISA is where I keep mine. I can still access it quickly, but I’m getting much better interest than if I’d left it chequeing
Keep it in a HISA
RBC already has rolled these out. Saw one over 2 months ago
HISA (high interest savings account)
Are you one?

Do you usually have to travel (or live in remote locations) to find good paying, steady work, or is this possible living in-town still?
according to my calculations the stock market is going to tank for 12 days starting September 9th of this year so wait until then to buy
Check the tape.... never walk in with the envelop already stuffed with cash do it at the cameras
Your friend doesn’t know much about finance and investing. Tell them to zip it next time they try to talk about this stuff and let the adults talk.
I am 35, married 15 years, two kids and travel solo to a new country every year. Sometimes multiple in one trip. How do I do it? I have a government pension that I’m comfortable with. I do not otherwise save for retirement. I keep a $10,000 savings for emergencies and that is all. I do not hoard money. I rent and probably won’t own. Two incomes helps, though we do not combine finances and I make more. I don’t live in Toronto or a high rent market though. Travelling and living in the moment is what gives my life meaning, and I will dedicate my life to seeing everything I can. It’s my priority, but not for everyone.
All that stuff about GICs from the Turner article makes sense, but what is a person to do with money that they'll need in the short to medium term? Everything I've read says if you're saving for a house or something that you'll be buying in the next 1 to 3 years you shouldn't risk it in any kind of investment. What other options are there?
>considering all this "recession" talk and unstable politics and a rocky economy do you think its a good time to buy?

They've been saying that for the last 5 years. Nobody knows when the recession will come. It will come, just nobody knows when. 

>should i maybe wait another year or so since its already up back to its ATH after the huge dip last december?

The markets have hit an ATH about 20 times since 2015, so that's a bad indicator. 

Remember that "*time in the market is better then trying to time the market*"

If you stomach can't handle 10-30% drops (it will happen a bunch of times in your investing life), you might want to re-evaluate your risk profile.
I think in any area related to finances that has fluctuation the phrase "wont happen" bites ALOT of people in the ass... it can always happen
Thanks. Much appreciated.
First tell us how many times you've heard the phrase "you shouldn't time the market", then ask that question again.
Millwright would get you to around 100k and if you get a union job its not bad work.
Why would you wait?  Do you know that it’s going to drop again?  If so, you’ve solved the stock market!
Foreign investment and speculation are already taxed in BC/Vancouver and are probably negligible to housing prices. Also, I don’t think many “locals” in Vancouver have been able to save significant amounts of cash with depressed wages + sky high rent.
Hard earned lesson but a good one at a 100K loss instead of the 700K+ many of the houses in Vancouver have dropped.  So many flippers have lost their life savings because they kept piling it all into the mortgage for the next one.  If you’re always all in then you only need to drop once to bust.
Won't happen. Vancouver/Toronto are self-sufficient and don't rely on oil prices. They're tourist hubs, foreigners own a lot of the property. Foreign buyers don't rely on Canada's economic position, only residents need to worry about eg. a lower income because oil price halved.
10-12 is definitely attractive. What size 2nds do you typically see. Dm me
No problem, thats cool. Nice and cheap there, but buddy trying to rip you off.
How long ago did they do 40 year amortizations?
Mogo shows credit score, not a credit report (that includes eaxct details of credit accounts). Borrowell and Credit karma do.
Congrats...that all I have to offer in terms of advice. You are in a tremendous position.
If you qualify with the sufficient household income, the Rogers Bank Mastercard (higher version) gives you 1.75% cashback and you can redeem it against any purchase on your statement now I think (as long as its above like $20 or $50). I think that's the highest % cashback card you can get right now.
I thought I was getting quality service, until I got my car safetied and found out I'd been riding around in a death trap.  No one bothered to mention the massive rust on the undercarriage despite a tire rotation just months earlier.
And Canada Life has coverage for traumatic brain injury.  Just to make the comparison even worse.

Some years ago I did a thorough read and comparison of most of the CI contracts out there.  That's clearly a bit dated, given what /u/ktown1984 said about Desjardins.  Desjardin's always tried to differentiate their contracts (they've got some coverage for some really 'weird' conditions that others don't - flesh eating disease, bacterial menengities, etc...IIRC).  Still, these differences IMO tend to be minor.

>I would also check to see is Sunlife has a "best doctors" feature

I think most companies have this, though good point, one should ask.  I mentioned that we had a CI claim in our family, and the best doctors was probably the most important part of the claims process.  As soon as we had a diagnosis, the immediate reaction was 'need information!', and that's basically what best doctors is.  Actually IIRC Manulife has an even better version of best doctors than most companies with an emphasis on better being subjective. My spouse spent quite  a bit of time on their database.  Best doctors also did a thorough review of the diagnosis and tests, providing their own appraisal of the results.    Which was very interesting, since some of the diagnosis was subjective.
If that sounds like too much effort for you - just get cash back cards. Generally pretty painless to use and I'm not convinced that magical travel points are worth more than investable cash.
Oh, thanks! It turns out I had to delete the account and reconnect. That worked. Simply re-entering my password on the existing account didn't.

It all updated now :)

Edit: Hmm, no. The card is there, but no transactions. Any idea how to get those in?
I appreciate your response. I have a brother who relocated from Ontario to Kelowna and loves it. I will hopefully be checking B.C. out soon. Thanks!
Slagathor is correct.

There are 2 types of credit. Lines of credit and credit cards both fall under the revolving type.

The other type would be things like loans. ie you borrow once
Yeah, I already tried that and they said to me to contact the grocer. I'll try by phone, though the last time I called, it took 90 minutes to get the line.
That's probably your best possible attitude. I'm not sure I could've been so understanding.  They basically said "figure it out yourself" but then denied you the one strongest tool that most would have to do it themselves: student loans.
Sounds like he is a resident of Canada (post-docs are usually here for a while).

He is taxed on worldwide income. The income and taxes paid in China will be (converted to CDN dollars) on his CDN tax return. The income will be regular income. The federal and local income tax paid in China will be a foreign tax credit on his CDN return (form T2209).

He can use various free software (Simpletax is popular and free) to do his taxes.

He should also be doing his Chinese income tax return as well.

Right now I just have the standard cash back MC from RBC, because we're new Canadians and it was a handy secured card available to someone with no credit established yet. I also really like the integration of having everything on one web site.

When we're coming up on our second year of Canadian tax returns, I'll look into what other (Costco, PC Financial, Capital One, etc) cash back MCs are out there as I'm sure some of them might yield us a little more cash back depending on our spending patterns and their terms.

I'm only interested in MCs specifically because I shop some places that don't take Visa.
In a small town I'd rather not say but the population is less than 5k
A good rule of thumb is that you shouldn't close any lines of credit/credit cards unless you're paying fees that you can't negotiate away. Unnecessarily closing will negatively impact your credit score, and realistically it shouldn't cost you anything to keep the cards around. Just spend 1 minute every other month checking that no fraudulent charges have been made on the card.
What city?
Contact PC Financial and explain them the details they can check with their backend team and rectify the error.
If he's selling mutual funds, complain to the MFDA (www.mfda.ca)
For years, I used to enjoy playing the credit card churning game and had some really great wins. At any one time, I would have 5 or 6 active cards and a couple of applications going. It was very exciting, but it took a spreadsheet to keep track of everything, threshhold spending, annual fees, and I got tired of that game. I now only use two cards: PC Financial MasterCard for everything, and I really like the simplicity of its reward program. But when I travel abroad or buy stuff in a foreign currency, my preferred card is the no-annual-fee Home Trust Visa with no FOREX fees and the usual travel coverage perks, including road-side assistance.
I moved away from Calgary in 2006 because it was the height of the market.  So glad I never bought in.
Agree. I hear a lot of this sentiment among the “losers” on the wrong side of the real-estate moat. “Burn it to the ground.”

I think this group of folks has been underestimated by the political parties. The appetite for radical change is there, among a fair portion of millennials, and others (im a gen-x, for what it is worth). I’m sure the pre-election polling has started. Might be interesting when this is revealed—if the polls ask the right questions, which is not a given.
Thanks for the information
That's not been my experience with my GP. We talk about my symptoms, my lifestyle and what changes I could make to improve things, and I receive follow-up calls to track my progress.
A house is a depreciating asset. 

The land it sits on is not an appreciating asset unless it is becoming more productive. Which it isn't, unless you're building an addition or adding solar panels or retrofitting for energy efficiency.

The only thing that's changing is: population has been growing exponentially but housing can only grow quadratically. Any programmers here want to do a Big O analysis of what happens in that situation?

Except population growth has only been growing exponentially on a global scale. Locally, if your town isn't growing, your real estate prices don't go up.
I've almost given up on ever owning my own place.
Late? At 30, you are way ahead than most. I was a clown until my early 40s, with no idea whatsoever about investing, retirement planning, etc. When I realized my poor situation, I had to scramble to build a decent portfolio. At 60, I still don't know much but I stay on top of things and have embraced frugality and voluntary simplicity that I truly enjoy. During my years as a clown, my saving grace was that I made really good money, even though I was spending a good amount on useless pursuits, like a drunken sailor.
My transactions stopped updating in January but this morning it finally worked again. Try on a computer instead of the app. I edited my log in and Rogers bank emailed a verification code which I entered into the mint website.
Is this a recent fix? Just tried, Mint said “we already have this account” and directed me here if I was experiencing connection issues: https://help.mint.com/Featured-Questions/1322908991/Known-Issue-Rogers-Bank-Canada-Jan-20-2019.htm

Says there is still a known issue, for “some”. So it may affect me and not you perhaps?
Default rates, on average are inline with the national average, maybe a bit higher. I've not had any private deals I've originated go into default. As I'm equally worried about my relationship with the lender and client. It needs to make sense. 

Some lender are obviously higher risk. And will do all sorts of crazy.
Sent you a pm
I am not the OP
The question was would OP get a full or partial rebate?

Property size is in excess of the full rabate.

The partial exemption mentions a second building.
Firsts take more capital typically, return on average is probably around 8% overall, seconds are around 10-12 on average
100% agreed. Glad I didn’t listen to him when I bought a house years ago
Dear Alberta, don't bother with the oil, it's short-term and destructive.

Retool to take advantage of your plentiful wind and solar and you'll need a place to house the people who are building it. And we'll all be better off.
Was there something wrong with the vehicle? Used vehicle?
Why would you "look with the grocer"? It's a double transaction, obviously you didn't buy two identical carts of groceries, it's an obvious mistake.  "Goods not received". Dispute transaction with the card issuer.
In terms of your credit score, no. Having a high percentage of unutilized credit is good for your score (less than 30% is the benchmark).

The flip side here is having a ton of credit may prevent lenders from extending you further credit in certain circumstances.
Do you have the assessed values? (Land vs buildings)
Let me pull up the form and see if I can calculate for you.
What kinda default rates do you see. I imagine the higher risk 2nd's would be where you see the better payoff as the investor. Have always wanted to dabble in it myself but returns seemed a little lackluster for the risk
My philosophy here is to have have rewards programs that work well together and are ideally portable. 

Right now I’m using RBC Avion (May switch for cobalt... but have 270k points to use), and amex Bonvoy. I also collect aeroplan. 

These programs all work pretty together because you can transfer between them pretty well. Ie:
- use Avion to buy AC flights and get aeroplan points
- use Bonvoy at Marriott to maximize gains when traveling on business. Use points on personal hotels, or transfer to aeroplan. 

In theory I would agree that there is risk in not being able to use points because you’re spread thin, but if you go with a portability strat it can work well.

If I did switch my Avion to cobalt tho I would def NOT get another travel rewards card. I’d probably go with a cashback card and only use it when amex isn’t accepted.
2046.48. Do you understand how interest gets calculated?
> Can you afford a $750000 house?

Yes. But more importantly could pick one up for an investment at those prices.

Once the conditions are such that local money is competing with local money then the market will be balanced and prices won’t continue to slump. That price is a lot higher than some people hope for. 

What is it you doubt? That prices will continue to slump?

I have my RRSP, non-registered and TFSA with Questrade and I think it’s great. I’ve been using Questrade for 7 years now and have built a nice, sizeable portfolio with them. You can choose to have individual stocks and manage it yourself or buy into their Questwealth portfolios where you buy ETFs and the robo-advisors will take care of the rest for you. It’s only $1000 to get started and you only pay $5/trade to buy and sell individual stocks and ETFs are free to buy (just $5 to sell). If you’re interested, you can click this link and get started:
http://www.questrade.com/?refid=5c9c2a62adcfa

I just set my wife up with a TFSA with Questrade.
So this is pretty much my question. If i do end up cancelling it how significant is the hit to my credit? Will it be negligible like dropping me 5 points? If thats the case i can wait till im deeper in the bracket so i stay rated "very good" but if it takes a few years to rebuild via another product it might be worthwhile to pay the $4 monthly for the sake of not taking two steps back for one forward....
Credit utilization is a contributor to your credit score. I *think* the lower the better (might be wrong tho) so having a low usage of the total credit available to you could be beneficial. However there may be a difference between lines of credit and credit cards. 

Only potential downside is if you need to go get a big loan (car loan?) or want to sign up for a new credit card or something... I think they look at your total available credit vs income when assessing whether or not to extend this. So if you have a ton of available credit you may not be given any additional when you need it.
In a way I resent my parents for having the means to help and not helping me out financially. They never taught me how to budget either so it's been an uphill battle. I took out huge loans that I've almost paid off. I wouldn't wish it on other young students.
> If the equity goes up in your house, what are the best options? Heloc probably? Take the money out and do something with it (if you can afford to do so)?


So long as it doesn't end up disappearing down some nonsense.  If you carry a debt you can never repay, that ain't good.
Unless you had clearly stated what ifs in the contract like if you didn’t see the vehicle and it came not to your liking etc you cant. 
This happened to me where a car was ordered but it was not as it was described and i got out of it and got my deposit back.  
It was a manufacturers dealership - which i think matters because used dealerships are something else.
hmm, I'll take a second look again as both should be the full set of coverages.

The key difference I see for now is that Sunlife maintains the main coverage, whereas Desjardins is reduced (since it's an "advance")
That only works under the assumption that bonds are anti-correlated with stocks, which was an okay assumption historically but is less clear nowadays.
If you hit the minimum income and travel on westjet at least once a year that card is a no brainer

It's still liquid if you "have to move" a few years after buying. If you sell your house within 5-10 years you will break even or lose out. Those who get a lot of money from flipping are lucky or well informed.

Nope if you signed if you are screwed, in Ontario there is no cooling off period for vehicle sales.  

Now I say you are screwed because the dealer doesn't have to concede to change anything and they unlikely will but you can always ask.
LoL ... I'll be sure to update this post once my funds have settled. For now though I was able to use part of the money that I technically shouldn't have to buy other stocks. If my remaining funds become withdrawable then this bug could actually ruin the app.
I agree that the angst about US dividend tax withholding is totally overblown on this forum. Taxes on earnings are a fact of life.

Rogers Bank is now working again in Mint
My parents and I struck a deal that I had to pay tuition/books/fun things, and they would pay for me to live. Throughout high school I had a couple good jobs and was always taught to save a portion of every paycheque. I did co-op so I only had to pay one semester at a time. They had been investing in RESPs to pay for their part of the deal.

Graduated with no school debt, which has been incredibly advantageous now in my “adult” years. I also have the type of parents that would have been able to pay for almost it all if something had come up. They instilled in me that education was important and that “you can’t waste money on school”. They also were the type that really encouraged me to take something I loved, rather than take something to get a job.
This is based on a scientific study of the methods actually used by naturopaths.  They aren't based on science.
Doubt it would happen. Worst it can be is 25% price correction. But at a million dollars, that's only $250000. Can you afford a $750000 house? How many people have been waiting for housing to drop and saved a chunk of money?
If the foreign investors leave and the market corrects, you're now competing with locals that have been patient and saving money. Suddenly the corrected market would be effected again as the locals start a price war....
The calculator only shows how much tax I would have to pay if I needed to pay in full.

I did this with my wife. She had her TFSA set up with TD DI but wanted to go back to simple efunds via easyweb. I had to go I to branch to get the paperwork filled out and then the rep transferred the funds over.

In the end it was basically a transfer in kind.
I feel like it comes from the advice of past generations. In their experience, yes, real estate may have always appreciated. Today's world moves too fast for their experiences to be applicable.

I never understood the thought of renting as the act of throwing away money. When you rent you exchange money for shelter; when you have a mortgage you exchange money for money for shelter.
You'll get charged a conversion fee if your purchasing in a CAD tfsa. You can open a US tfsa and buy and sell in USD.

It's unbelievable, I'm currently renting a house my grandpa owned and sold to my parents for 45k then my parents sold it for 60k now my landlord did some minor upgrades, mind you all by himself so it's not really professional to say the least and he's trying to sell it for 160k in a buyer's market. The house has already been on market for two years now and he called me the other day asking me if I wanted to buy it before he puts it under a new contract with different realtor, yeah no thanks.

With a proper divetsified portfolio of stocks and bonds, the worst thing to ever happen was the GFC of  2008/09 and it only took 2 years to recover. Edmonton real estate has been down for 12 years.
Lol that’s awesome. I also remembering in the boom 12-15 years back people actually saying ‘my house has made me $x’... keep in mind if you sell that house and stay in the same neighbourhood/city/general area you’re not taking advantage of the situation. 

If the equity goes up in your house, what are the best options? Heloc probably? Take the money out and do something with it (if you can afford to do so)?

Thing is, I'm pretty sure that oil is now long term down.  EVs are nearly at threshold for early adopters, and insulation improvements are now a standard part of every new version of building code - hitting the top two sources of oil consumption on the long term.

Also, mined petroleum seems to have a long-term competitor coming up in yeast, algal, and bacterial generated oils.  These would be seen as more renewable and offer security to countries that can't mine it - again hitting on price.

Certainly there's a heavily diverse market for petroleum products, but with the top 2/3rds of demands and a renewable and secure competitor, the only direction I see for oil in 20 years is down.

Don't bet on it.
Is ONA membership mandatory for nurses? As I understood it, you can only claim mandatory fees (CNO for sure, ONA only if mandatory). Don't forget about your liability insurance.

Union dues should be on your T4.
Private lending in this sense sucks, yes. As a Mortgage guy, I work with alot of private lenders, and the return is typically much more significant.
I worked through it myself, which meant that I had to take long public transit commutes (because I couldn't afford a car) and had to live at home for the 4 years. 

If I had more financial help, I may have still worked through the period myself, but may have been able to buy a car, pay for things like gas, or maybe live in an apartment on my own or with friends instead of at home with my parents (edit: or just take on less hours and not burn out working 5 days a week and attending school full time). I think the working experience was very important, but having more help won't make that experience impossible. It might just make having other experiences (like living on your own, learning to budget for food and other costs, etc) more possible at the same time. It's probably more related to how you approach/allocate the funding, rather than just having the funding itself.
You really should know what you are invested in.  I find it hard to believe you lost money.  I think it is more a case that you didn’t make as much as others that are bragging about their own ‘success’.
True. That’s the concern. Website does not say if it’s for life of the mortgage (say 25 years) or term of the mortgage
Ahhhh should have guessed. You have a lot of work in front of you if he is in investors group for starters. I mean for starters you can just try getting him into branch level mutual funds, show him they either have better returns or at the very least similar returns with lower MER's. Just for a start. I'm sure I read on here of a person with investors group that lost money in one of their growth funds from 2009 to present day, something I would have thought was very hard to achieve in that time period.
You'll get noting since it's a non-refundable tax credit.

If China and India go bust Toronto real estate is probably in trouble.
It's why I think Capital One really hamstring themselves by not letting customers switch cards. A lot of people get their cards to either build credit or rebuild credit, then when they have they don't want to keep a card with a yearly fee with no benefits anymore but understand that closing their oldest credit product will hurt their credit a bit (and they're obviously the credit score sensitive people) and capital one could easily keep their business by letting them switch to a different product. Doesn't make sense to me.
Lmao what is it then? Nice math

Great read, thanks for sharing.
Same experience. Moving to Canada recently was like going backwards thirty years in time as far as banking is concerned.
Which fund is he paying 2.6% on through a bank? Sounds like it would be a specialized fund rather than their branch level funds usually offered, he could at least open a DI account and purchase it through their at a much lower MER if he really likes the fund.
I really want to plan but with basically no spare change, I don't know how to plan. I'm waiting for my husband to be done school (this year) and hope he can find something in his field soon. He is in health sci and would be doing lab stuff. Jobs are not readily available for new grads in our city so he may have to relocate, at least for a little while.

I am just hoping paying down the mortgages would be beneficial in the long run. I do have pension but things can change so much before I retire, so I don't know what to think of that either.

I have 2k in a DC pension from my previous job so I'm playing with that money to try learn about investments to prepare for who-knows-how-much-later.

That's pretty much all we've got so far... I feel like we can't afford kids in the near future.
I lived in Europe ten years ago and these were standard. Never saw one that took envelopes. Not sure why so many aspects of banking are so far behind here....
Same boat (but Calgary). Have faith in history and the fact that Oil has always bounced back for longer than you and I have been alive. 

Jason Kenny will start the ball and when Trudeau gets the punt we will continue to see growth in the West and investment come back to Alberta
I live in a rural area, nearest city is 90 min away, so we have no choice but to save now knowing that housing will likely also be a factor for our child once they are in university. From that perspective the extra $500 a year is hard to pass up on.
I doubt very much that immigrants will be snapping up housing unless the prices drop 50-60%
It's awful you experienced that, but they have regularly been my most professional service experience. Perhaps I'm lucky enough to have better managed stores near me.
It don't see how saving and investing for years is a "free ride".  Take that CCB money they are giving you and put it into their future.
My grandparents actually saved up for me and my brothers. Both of my brothers moved away, had to take some student loans, but mostly had their education paid for. I stayed home, had to take student loans, and had a lot of my education paid for. My brothers are huge savers who both bought a home in their late 20s and have maxed out RRSPs, TFSAs and lots of savings. I spent like crazy in my 20s and got in debt that I'm almost out of now, I don't think helping to pay for your kid's education will change who they are. However, it will be very helpful in the end as it will allow them to get an education. I have friends who couldn't go to University or College because their parents wouldn't help.
unfortunate for customers of that store.

I have regularly been "sold down", IE advised on things it's ok to skip for now, or had minor things waved off with no charge. EG I recently had my front brakes replaced, and brought it back due to a squeaking noise, turns out that was some building rust on the rear brakes. They never touched them, but they gave it a clean, measured the brake depth, and sent me on my way, no charge. No doubt it's possible for some garages to be unethical, but that is true of ALL garages.
Secured? Do you mind me asking what rate you got?
I'm asking:
In the qualification it says this

I read this as it could have a second building, but doesn't say it must or shall.
Both my kids love school and work hard to get great marks.  I don't plan on burdening them with having to pay for post secondary education on their own, provided their strong work ethic continues.
I'm not but I have helped set up RRSP and TFSA accounts with them.  InvestEase was using RBC index ETFs but they have recently switched to iShares ETFs.

Far from the only one.
I was never given a dime, and I graduated last year. I was paying rent at 18 and moved across the country to study in Nova Scotia, after two years of working full-time+ skilled construction to save. Being raised by a single parent with no financial assistance from the other is a whole different story.

That being said I am glad to *help*(not covering the entire bill) out with my future kids’ school, but I expect them to be employed in high school and do some saving for themselves. For example, taking the bus to work and school, until they can save for a cheap car to use. Work for a year after they graduate to see what they like.

Being employed in high school (which is becoming more rare these days) builds confidence and responsibility at a young age that is priceless.
Same. I saw some of those medium/medium high Canadian based dividend funds down last year but January and February alone was enough to almost bounce back completely.
Found the Canadian Tire marketing rep.

Joking aside, CanTire have been responsible for my three worst auto-mechanic experiences, out of the four times I brought my car there when I was too young and foolish to know better.  They have broken my hubcaps, spilled battery acid on my back seat, and popped one of my tires.  Each of these was at a different location.

They are the EA of auto services.
Vancouver is more diversified in industries that make significantly much less money. The real estate economy is that region's primary wealth creator.
thing is that if you sell but are also buying another piece of real property in an affected area then you are not really any worse off.

But the home you live in should not be treated as an investment, I fully agree with that.
I have 3 and all are cash back. I use only 2 though, just bought something on my VISA for the first time in 10 months... totally forgot I even had the card... Generally I like the cash back and I mostly use my AMEX simply cash because it is better than the Tangerine MC for most things. I buy, gas, groceries and bills like netflix, cell ect on the MC. Everything else I can goes on the AMEX. When I got it paid out in September I got almost 1k paid out. That's in addition to my \~$400 I got on my MC. Money for just shopping is okay by me. Not like if I used debit it is any cheaper so use CC with max rewards I can get.
Fair enough
I’m in the same boat. Just remember, the best time to invest is 10 years ago. The second best time is today.
He can't get 5% from the bank because most of the population is not going to get a 40k LOC/ULON at that interest rate, banks lend at the rate or lower when they can secure it against a property. So effectively you're willing to take on risk that pretty much every lender in Canada isn't willing too.
I agree this is probably the issue referred to by your friend (or misunderstood by your friend). I just asked about this in a related thread today. The withholding is done automatically, so you will have no tax to pay at a future date. It does mean that the dividend reinvested in your account is 85% of what it should have been (due to 15% withholding tax). The only way to avoid this is to buy the same shares in an RRSP, with the catch that you have to buy them through a foreign broker in US dollars.  This will have it's own set of charges (including currency exposure and commission), apart from the hassle, and is probably not worth the savings unless you have a high balance.  See [https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/beyvig/foreign\_withholding\_tax\_on\_foreign\_assets\_in\_tfsa/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/beyvig/foreign_withholding_tax_on_foreign_assets_in_tfsa/)
I haven't, but if it's something of interest I could do it! By no means am I making a ton of money on YouTube but I make enough that it's worth while for me.
Right, but my point was "maxed out resps" is hardly a "free ride"
Technically in Tangerine (OP's bank) the payee is listed as "PRESIDENTS CHOICE FINANCIAL MASTERCARD" but yes, your answer is more correct than the others. If you try searching "PC Financial" in Tangerine it only gives you an option for insurance services or something like that which is probably not right.
Yet you want to judge Edmonton based on a three line post?
Why? I have gotten exceptional service every time I have gone. I have nothing but good things to say.
Yes I know the TFSA is an account type not an investment. I mentioned the "parts of the TFSA" invested in foreign countries. By "part" I meant the same thing you did by "holdings", i.e., one of the underlying securities.

Thanks for confirming there's no US withholding on interest, which I wasn't sure about.
I appreciate that but *shrug* it is what it is. They did what they thought was going to be best for my character. Maybe it worked in a roundabout way. They were probably broke and in debt too, considering apples and how they fall from trees. The more i fuck up as a parent the more sympathy i have for boomers and their nearly century-old mindset. We are a species barely out of it's feral phase.
My Visa allows me to get a credit towards my balance and it’s fairly straightforward to cash them in when I’ve accumulate enough points.

My Rogers World Elite allows me to redeem the cash back whenever I want.  It adds up because we use it for most of our daily household spending.  We do most of our grocery shopping at Costco as well, so we get an additional 2% back on those purchases.
Agreed. This is possible, but the first thing op should be doing is ensuring ex spouse could actually qualify for the mortgage needed under current stress test rules via a broker/bank. Then draft up via lawyer/mediator the agreement.
I just stick to cash back. It's simple, there's no figuring out how to game the "points" system most effectively (which I find *not at all interesting*) and I have mine set up to just automatically dump into my bank account every January. No muss no fuss, free money.
>*Source: I've never seen a meaningful message at a TD ATM.*

I think they were making a joke
Lol wut?
Thank you, thank you.
> It will take a lot to cause the Toronto market to seriously "crash".

Yes, and that may happen in the future. Nothing goes up forever. Everything goes up and down.
Not to mention, a mortgage won't go up 4% per year
I have 2 cards, an amex travel card that I get 4% back on gas and groceries and a capital one travel card that I use everywhere amex is not accepted. I've had the cards for just over a year each, and I have about 1500 dollars combined in travel points.

I also only use my credit cards, no debit or cash, and I pay them off fully every week
Yeah, I got tired of not being able to make a place my own, renovations, painting, having guests stay more than a couple weeks. I hate having landlords.
It’s neither of the two mentioned
“PRESIDENTS CHOICE FINANCIAL”
My bad
Which is exactly what you should be doing.

Markets go up and down. Nothing goes up forever.

20 years have gone by since the last crash - but all that means is that we're now 20 years closer to the next one.

Will it eventually happen? Absolutely. Does anyone know when? Probably not.
I bought it as a residence not a rental property. Then I had to move.
A bonafide sales clause should be avoided all all costs if possible. this alone has potential to derail some one for thousands of $$$
Thanks for being so detailed! The crossover point is 18 years. Can I ask what locked in transfer is (the pension plan is already "locked in")? We have options A (joint no guarantee), B (joint guarantee 5 Yr), and C/D/E/F (single no/5/10/15 Yr guarantee).
That’s good on you though. We only have 2 and fortunate enough to keep our jobs through the downturn in Alberta. 

I just hope they have that drive that you had at that age. 

I think discussing finances and educating them will help them understand instead of just telling them what to do.
If they are up by 100%, it needs to crash by 50%.  
  
A 100% drop would be down to $0.
Just government loans.
This is along the lines of what I am hoping to do as well.
Thanks for the response, I am using a paid Turbo Tax. I've considered moving to SimpleTax, but just haven't for some reason or another (just stubborn I think, lol). I've reviewed the generated T1's and it looks like all provincial information has been entered so I think I'm OK. Maybe I'll throw everything into simple tax just as a verification. Thanks again
Still waiting. In the meantime I'll just keep living life.
The problem is you bought your house as a speculative asset, not as a place to live in. It doesn't matter how expensive or cheap it is if it feels like home to you. Hong Kong is what happens when you speculate your home: it screws everyone except the rent seekers, cost of living goes through the roof  and everyone is miserable.
> Canadian Tire

You are a brave soul.
I only have cash back cards so I use whichever one gives me the best percentage back.
The only card I have that has redemption limitations is my MBNA Smart Cash. All my other cards are straight up cash monthly or annually.
No but that is the start... and if they choose to go  To a local college/university it would pretty much be enough along with a summer job to cover almost at the costs.

We’re fortunate enough to have quality schools in our area.
And Mogo
Side question: 

&#x200B;

I am claiming the interest I paid on my OSAP loan for 2018. Can I also claim the interest paid on my Student Line of Credit with a private lender (RBC)? Or is it just government loans?

&#x200B;

Thank you, first time doing taxes myself.
No. I bought it to live in. Never as an investment or rental. Then market crashed and I had to move. So I ended up with a rental property I never intended.
Market went down like crazy, I think they just built too much, too quickly. Once someone down the road sold for 20-30k less than what the paid for it, it was like dominoes
That's shitty, sorry you had to go through that. Not being able to apply for loans because your parents won't even divulge facts?  Shame on them, frankly.
Their website suggests clearing your history/ cache/ cookies and if that doesn't work contacting them.  Since you have not had success with either suggestion perhaps it would be simpler to just use SimpleTax instead.  (Hopefully you weren't  using a paid version of TurboTax.)
 Christ no kidding. The idea of owning a house sounds amazing to me but the reality of it ever happening is slim to none. I'm just so sick of landlords and other tenants I want my own house so I can renovate how I want it to look and make it my home. Not someone else houses I'm living in so I cant really enjoy it like I would if it were my own.
See this is what I am hoping for. I have no issues with providing what I can to assist. You seem to be doing everything in your power to make it an easy decision for them.
As I understand it, a person should try hold onto their oldest credit card account so they don’t lose that credit history and negatively affect their credit score.  Assuming that is true, once OP has been approved for their new card, I would recommend seeing if their original CC provider, Capital One, has a no fee card that their account could be switched to.  Depending on the terms they may have to use it once a year to keep the account active.
Box 42 represents amounts earned as commissions.

Yes the amount is included in box 14 however you may claim expenses that you have incurred to earn this $2,201.79
The moment the market dips in Toronto, 50,000 new immigrants and people coming to Toronto will snap up the property - let alone all the hundreds of thousands if not millions who are currently renting and sitting on money because they can't afford the market.

&#x200B;

It will take a lot to cause the Toronto market to seriously "crash". Like /u/RationalSocialist, I agree it will only be stabilization or a minor dip - prices are not going back to what they were in 2005.
Is it really more stable? Many stocks are strongly correlated, so you'd have to diversify elsewhere to reduce risks in case of a black swan event which can wipe out tens of % of your worth over the course of a few days or weeks.
Can't really borrow a downpayment on a house.
~~Ten~~ Fourteen years ago i got accepted into school, but couldnt save enough money at $11/hour to pay in full, couldnt get aid because my parents wouldnt cosign or even provide any details about their finances ("it is not a childs business to know the finances of the parents") and expected me to figure it out on my own. I became discouraged, confused by internet advice, had a useless checked out guidance councelor, and ended up just not going. "Ill just work this year to save, and apply next year" i kept telling myself. A few years of that flawed philosophy go by, a promotion happens, a shift to a lateral but better paid job with another company and before i knew it i was a grownup with rent and a hydro bill and the window for education continues to shrink. I never developed responsible financial management either, so it was a downward spiral of poor credit decisions and paycheck-to-paycheck spending which worsened the gap to freedom and compounded the hopeless feeling towards my educational ~~goals~~ fantasy.

 Still my fault entirely for not trying harder and letting myself blame others for my paralysis-by-analysis, but goddamn if it wouldn't have been easier if even just the first year was covered enough to get my foot in the door and gain some traction. Even just applying to schools by yourself is confusing and scary and expensive. To answer your question (finally), I think it depends individually on their maturity and life-preparedness. If you raise hard workers that respect money and value their education your help will not damage their character. If they show flakiness and poor decision making enough to concern you, you may already have your answer. Should every kid get a free ride to their PhD? Fuck no. But if my kid shows promise towards that PhD, as a parent now I want nothing more than to open the door and show them how easy can be to step forward. 

TLDR: responsibility and character happen long before tuition is due.

Edit: 14 years ago. Jesus christ it still feels like last summer. This feeling eventually stops, right oldtimers??
Copy all boxes as they appear on your T4 to whatever tax program you're using. Box 42 from your T4 gets copied to box 42 in your tax program, etc
where did you move? this will likely be my scenario in a few years
I read the article and I will check out the podcast. Thanks.
Was it because new houses depreciate in value quickly (like new cars), or is it just the market going down?
They aren't talking about churning, that's something else
Yes, that's an option. Thank you. Everything would be a whole lot easier if they offered index funds at a low cost.
Found it.

Thanks for confirming that withholding also applies to RESPs.

Edit: and another +1 for the PWL article. Thanks.

TLDR for other readers: The savings, at least in the example in the PWL article, remain below $1,000/year until the fund is above about $500,000
depends on the card. I have 3 cards

* Tangerine just gives straight up money in my account. Who cares how slowly it accumulates...$1 is $1
* Amex Cobalt just accumulates long term for an eventual trip, I have close to 80,000 points now
* Triangle gives me Canadian Tire money, which use in bursts when I bring my car in for service.
You actually lost money over a 5 yr period in a Canadian dividend fund? What fund is it? Generally curious
Or is it already taken care of for box 14?
I understand your point, but where i live, a 3.29% interest rate doesnt exist - lowest is 5% if you are very lucky and you have to pass a stress test and quality for more than your rate. Also, a 1 bedroom condo is more than 329k.
I appreciate contextual relevamce but i was going from my context in my location. A townhouse is 500k here. So where i live, its stupid if you already barely have enough for even a 5% down payment and you wanna be house poor.
Thanks for the answer, but I don't think it is wise to ignore the withholding tax aspect when comparing investment vehicles.

If a stock/fund pays a 3% dividend, that would be 2.55% if there is a 15% withholding tax.

For $10,000 with compounding dividend reinvestment over 20 years, that's a difference of about $1,500.

Edit: the $1,500 is in 20 yr future money though, so the annual savings and present value is very small. Thanks for the point about having to buy from foreign brokers in order to avoid the withholding tax. This is indeed more hassle than it's worth (except as the other poster stated below, if you have a large balance).
You're way overthinking this. As many other people have already pointed out, just DRIP your dividends, unless you think you have a better use for them elsewhere (a better investment), hint: you probably don't.
>they look at me like I'm speaking a different language.

To be fair, you Aussies do have a funny way of talking sometimes. ;)

(<3 Welcome to Canada!)
It all depends on the size of the bubble and how well the (local) economy is doing.
My parents gave us free room and board as long as we were in school but we had to pay all of our other costs. I lived at home for the first 3 years. SO parents paid for everything.   We both would have been happy to do what our parents had done.  The following was our compromise.

When our sons turned 18 we "gave" them the bank accounts where their Family Allowance payments had been deposited.  That added up to about $12,500 each.  

When they were in university we gave them the EAP portion (government grants and growth) portions of their RESPs.  They were age 6 and 9 when CESGs began so that was only about $15700 each.  When they finished university we transferred the contribution portion to our retirement savings.  (We had been prepared to give it to them if they had needed it.)

Our contribution (the bank accounts plus the growth on our contributions to the RESPs) added up to about 30% of the total education and living costs calculated by NSLSC. 

They both had decent scholarships, worked every summer and applied for student loans.  They both paid off their loans before graduation and graduated at the top of their class.  Neither has lived at home since they started university.  At age 26 and 29 they both have six figure investment accounts.

>Has anyone got any articles about young adults taking more ownership of their education

I know Andrew Hallam does.  I'll see if I can find it.
As a government worker, I WISH we all made 90k+. It can take years of applications just to get into government these days for a 50k job due to competition. I'd estimate 1 in 10 makes that much.
Second house? Or farm building? 

Is the property a working Farm?
Yes!, if you go to the ptt website they will help you calculate
I don't spend enough to get good value from a yearly-fee card personally, but if you do plan on spending more/making more use of air miles/etc... more power to you. I myself use the Tangerine card (and my old original Visa which has no yearly fee)

The interest rate on a credit card 'should' be fairly immaterial. The goal should be to never carry a balance on one, so it doesn't really matter too much if your theoretical interest is 10% or 20%, since your actual interest paid would be $0 since you pay your statement balance in full every month.

Just do be aware that the approval process for the Tangerine card is wonky. Some folks with excellent income, lots of cash in a Tangerine savings account, immaculate credit histories, etc... get declined. Meanwhile someone with multiple missed payments, etc... get approved.

I'd say, once you have your New Card for a couple months to make sure everything has posted, get rid of the old $50 yearly one. No sense paying money for something you wont use. Plus there's the possibility of something getting charged to it from an online purchase where your old card was saved on your account for instance and not noticing and missing payments!

Just make sure you go through say your last year's worth of statements from Old Card and make sure you don't have any recurring bills set to automatically charge to it before you close it down.
\>   Throw all your life savings into a potentially depreciating asset .....  People need to get their heads out of their asses.

&#x200B;

Is the world flat too?     Is Trump telling the truth?    Let's do some math.

Let's assume - we're both age 24.  I'm going to purchase my house.  You're going to rent.      At age 24 we have what roughly 50 years before we head to the retirement home.      Since this is personal finance canada, and we want to limit our interest expense lets compare 18yr term on the mortgage.

&#x200B;

I just googled - a brand new starter home here in Calgary is roughly $380K.  Rent on a similar is roughly $1900.    let's assume a inflation increase of 3%.   Therefore rent&property tax will go up 3%.    Let's assume an interest rate of 3.29%.  (TD 5yr fixed offer right now).    Let's assume we have 10% down.     So 342K @ 3.29%, 18 yr term.  Est property tax $2200 per year.  And property maintenance at an average 1200 per year.    We wont count utilities because that's a wash between the scenarios.  

&#x200B;

Renting:

Year 1 rent - 1900.  Year 50 rent - $8086 per month!!!   Total paid over 50 years.  $2,571,769

&#x200B;

Buying:

Using mortgage calculator:   [http://itools-ioutils.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/MC-CH/MCCalc-CHCalc-eng.aspx](http://itools-ioutils.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/MC-CH/MCCalc-CHCalc-eng.aspx)

Interest over 18 year amortization:    $110,834.   My monthly payment $2096.46.

Property Tax over 50 years:  $248153

Maintenance over 50  years: $135,356

House Equity at year 50:   1,617,363.

&#x200B;

Net of all this:

Renting:   Cost your 2.57m

Buying:  Cost me:  \~0.5m.     I also end up with an asset worth $1.62m.     You ended up with nothing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Let me put my tin foil hat on with you and assume that property values will never go up.   (Wrong of course but you seem to think the home will depreciate.).     In that scenario at the end you still have a home worth the same 380K you paid for it.   You're still way the fuck ahead of the renting scenario.

&#x200B;

More practical side of this - at age 65 when you'll be hoping to retire your rent will be $6383 per month!   (still the same 1900 in today's dollars).   How will you retire with that immense cost.   You've given 2,5 million of your hard earned cash to your land lord over the years.    So you didn't put as much money away as I did after I finished paying my mortgage.

&#x200B;

Yes I know I excluded the investment of 38K initial downpayment in the rental scenario.   Depending on your rate of return, (5%= 410K at year 50)  this eats into the advantage of buying a home.    However I also didn't consider investing at year 19 with my extra cash flow from not having a mortgage.    At any rate - in your scenario - always do the math.

&#x200B;

EDIT1: One more thing:  I'd avoid condo's like the plague.  The fees that you pay are an additional lost cost.    And I don't know if it's the same in Ontario but owners getting cash calls for large expenses in condo's seems more common than it should be.    If that's too much $$$ per month for you,  get a roommate or even 2.

&#x200B;

EDIT2:   There is literally nothing else in this world that most people have access to that will give you the kind of financial leverage that your home will.

&#x200B;

EDIT3:   Darn it.  Forgot home insurance.  Obviously a renter will need some insurance as well but it's cost will be quite a bit lower.     I wont update the numbers but 1800 per month in year 1 that's roughly 110K over 50 years with inflation.
This should just be common sense
I have two.  One TD Infinite Cash Back that used to be my only card (but I don't use anymore), but then I got the RBC Westjest card, to take advantage of the companion vouchers and free checked bags, and the reward dollars are a nice bonus.  Even just making one trip a yer, with the family more than pays for the annual fee.
This isn’t good personal finance advice. Don’t get me wrong, it’s good financial advice, but you’re responding to someone who has holdings they’re unfamiliar with in an RRSP at a bank.

For most people, even taking the step to initiate a transfer to another institution, let alone opening a discount brokerage account, is terrifying. Recommending they perform NG to purchase ETFs on an US exchange is so far beyond the advice they need right now. You’re talking about going from being 95% optimized to 100%. 

Getting them from where they are to being passively invested in a diversified, low-cost portfolio should be the goal. Whether that is with Tangerine, e-Series, a robo or DIY - that gets them 80-90% of the way there and there’s nothing wrong with that for now.
I see, so in my example, both scenarios would have a profit of $9 but for the one I DRIPped, I only have to pay tax on the $5?
Entering and leaving the market can also be partial (moving into a more expensive or a cheaper house results in money flow).
Yes I know a third party manages it but because two people are there taking out the money doesn't mean they are verifying it. The money is removed and verified at an off site location. There are large amounts of money coming out of the atm and nothing is verified by the crew removing it. They just put it in a bag and it gets sent to a cash processing center to get verified.

Money goes missing quite often and an investigation will get done everytime. It's not always the customer who is responsible.
Not standard. Each credit card issuer has their own processes.
What the friend probably means is that US taxes will be withheld on dividends. The average dividend yield of the S&P 500 is about 1.7%, so you would lose 15% of 1.7% times the share of your account else in US equities.

However, many tech companies never issue dividends, so there's nothing to tax.

There are programs such as Aeroplan where you can earn points towards with various cards, TD, CIBC, Amex, as well as many other types of points can be exchanged for Aeroplan points. You rack up all these types of points and cards and pool them together. It takes some work, but is fun. 

It’s also well worth it to diversify to other programs for hotel rewards, etc. There are many different points you can use in trip planning in conjunction with each other.
Save your pitch for McDavid lol
Crashes are temporary, real estate costing 10-20x your salary is forever. Crashes effect everyone, this real estate situation creates two classes of Canadians, winners and losers. You know what me and every other loser thinks about your precious "if we stop this train everyone feels pain" rhetoric? Burn it to the fucking ground, I feel no sympathy and you are stupid for expecting it from people who are already feeling the effects you're whining about.
Beat the bank by Larry Bates and Canadian couch potato!
To reduce the income someone needs to raise a family, to reduce the stress people take on with sky-high mortgages, to make our dollars go further, hopefully to boost the economy by letting people making under 6 figures spend casually instead of paying it all into rent or mortgage
Questrade doesn’t charge any fees to buy ETFs that outcompete the mutual fund market, I can tell you which ETFs are the right ones to buy for long term growth
If you want to compare outcomes for different income-types (from ABI profits to cash in owners hands) see the 3rd tab [of my spreadsheet](http://www.retailinvestor.org/ods/taxIntegration.xlsx) ..   The web's information on the tax rates on income are not relevant because it is only the round trip that matters, and outcome change depending on time periods and tax brackets.
You’re talking about churning. There are entire subreddits dedicated to it.

Expect to get PMs from “friendly” and “helpful” Redditors who give you advice expecting you to give them as referrals in return.
That fact that you even ask this question... is a sign of how fucked up housing is.

Some people want to own a home so they can live in it. Not everyone buys a home as a financial investment that is obligated to grow and go up in value.
Have you looked at tuition prices lately for university? Putting enough contributions to max out the RESP grants won't be enough for 4 years of university
You will pay the foreign withholding on TFSA, RESP and unregistered accounts.  For the unregistered account you will get a tax credit for the foreign with holding, which you may or may not be able to use.  

Unless you have a large portfolio the withholding doesn't add up to much.  eg. It could be 15% of a 3% dividend paid on 60% of your total portfolio.  It can be avoided  on US dividends in an RRSP if you have US listed assets but in order to do that you will pay currency conversion or pay to do Norbert's Gambit.  [This PWL article](https://www.pwlcapital.com/cutting-3-etf-portfolio-into-5-etf-portfolio-rrsp-account/)  explains how to figure out when the benefit outweighs the cost.
But if the prices never go up what's the point in owning?
Ya the river valley is nice!
Hi, you should check out this website:

https://remote.co/remote-jobs/recruiter/

They have remote jobs, and there is a section for remote HR/ recruitment jobs, they currently have 27 HR job openings. Just have a look through carefully, sometimes the jobs want someone working remotely in the US but other jobs can be done anywhere in the world.
The rate of increase is nosediving!!!!!!
It has never, ever, not once hit 40 above in Edmonton. Ever. It has hardly ever hit 30.

-40 is also pretty rare. We just had the coldest month in 30 years, and the low during that month never hit -40.
I'd be happy if prices tanked and never went back up. It's absurd that housing costs such a huge percentage of people's wages in the first place.
Location. Location. Location. 

People expecting a house in some random town anywhere in the country to have constant growth are the problem.
There's plenty of terrible things that could tank the Toronto and Vancouver markets.
There's a lot of virtual recruitment jobs...
I'm in the same boat.  Still a few years away from even talking about tuition.  Just focus on the grades for now 👍
How much do places in there rent for? Just curious, might be a great place to invest! How close to UofA?
If you have a sizable group of friends to do this with there is wayyyy more value in sharing a large house then renting condos.
It's for sure *not* true. When you look over long enough horizons--like hundreds of years--residential real-estate does not appreciate in value in real terms. The long-term real return rate in housing is about 0%.

Only when you cherry pick shorter terms, like of a few decades, do you sometimes see real growth. It makes sense that people would only focus on the most recent few decades because people don't live hundreds of years. But when you look at the long term data, it shows that housing doesn't grow.
Nothing. You'll owe no taxes to anyone.
Are you looking for an ETF option ? If so in the RRSP I would recommend a usd S & P 500 ETF in a self directed bank or questrade account . VOO would be a great option for 50k , it has a low mer of 0.05 percent , 2 percent dividend with no witholding tax in the rrsp , it's well diversified with large companies who operate internationally and the index has averaged 10 percent annually over its lifetime. You can convert your money to usd with a very low fee using norberts gambit. This is a great option for your RRSP.  It's a us large company  equity index ETF so over 30 years you will get the s and p return plus a 2 percent dividend annually . It's not very risky at all over a 30 year horizon you will make out well and you will minimize fees and witholding taxes . Why give someone half a percent of your returns for something you can easily do yourself , over 30 years the mer of the funds plus the robo fees are going to eat away at your returns significantly.
It's good to be informed but be wary of expert's predictions.... Most didn't see the 2008 crash coming and after it happened they started predicting Canada was immediately next ... 10 years later and we are still waiting for our housing market to crash... Any second now

Not saying there aren't any bad signs or that it cannot happen... Just saying it is wise to take these expert opinions with a grain of salt
I'm Canadian.

What about when I withdraw my investment later in life?
You have all that ACB stuff wrong.   All the money spent to buy securities ends up in the ACB of **some**security.  If you spend the $dividends received to buy more of the same Stock1 then the ACB of Stock1 increases  If you spend the $div to buy Stock2 then the ACB of Stock2 increases.  Neither should impact your decision where to invest the cash.  

Neither choice has any impact on the value of your portfolio or the price you would get from selling all its assets (all else equal ignoreing fall in price when dividend paid) or your profits.  You are just exchanging cash for an asset of equal value.  Your unrealized (or realized if you sell) profit has not changed.  You exchanged cash = $div for either Stock1 or Stock2 = $div.  So if you sell just those additional shares bought you would have $0 profit.  

The ACB determines what is taxed, not your profit.  As the others say above, a higher ACB for some $x value of stock is a good thing because you will pay less tax.  But here the ACB goes up by the same value that the position in the stock goes up.
A branch rep can do this for you and I don’t think there are fees
Your friend is wrong. Now I know its personal finance and everyone likes the safe stuff, but the FAANG related portion of my USD TFSA has been up like 250% in the last 3 years. All tax free
I’m one of those people that thinks declining home assessments mean lower house prices. But I, not the person you responded to.

I’m also hoping for a big decline, maybe a massive investor class exit,  but I doubt it’s coming in the kind of percentages that would make a difference. Fortunately I bought 10 years ago and am very happy I did.
Property is never liquid... Judging by your lessons learned, you were seriously misinformed going in
Canadian dividend funds I believe. At Medium Risk.
Let me guess, so you can buy a house at rock bottom prices and as soon as you do the market goes back up?
Quite true.

I bought new in '88 - a few years later.  Still here 30 years later!
What, is writing a few scribbles on a piece of paper not secure enough for you? /s
I generally go for medium risk and am thinking around 30 years.
Time frame and risk tolerance ?
Are you a US citizen or US tax resident? If so, you should completely avoid having a TFSA.

If not, US investments in a TFSA are fine. If the investment pays a dividend the IRS will keep a small part of that dividend and you will get the rest. And that's it. There will be no more US taxes in your TFSA.

And this US dividend withholding will happen automatically, you won't have to do anything and won't have anything to fill out anything in your taxes.
How so?
Depends on the prenup
Are you one of these people that thinks 'declining home sales' means lower house prices?
I don't believe you are taxed at all in your TFSA
This person had some great tips, however, you can definitely live comfortably in Toronto on a salary like that without having to make toothpaste. I make $70k and I live alone in a one bedroom condo near King West very comfortably while still managing to save money. You can’t go “crazy” on that salary but you just have to prioritize what you want to spend your money on. For example, I don’t ever eat out/get takeout on my own (I will if it’s with friends for social purposes) and I don’t drink much alcohol so food/drinks doesn’t take up a large chunk of my budget, so it leaves me more money to spend on things I enjoy (clothes, getting my hair done, skincare, etc).

Start with Canadian couch potato. Canadian portfolio manager.
I'm feeling for you buddy. I have property in Australia, built a brand new house when I lived their for $430,000 in 2011 (at the time it was cheaper than buying existing, and seemed like a logical option). Currently I have it on the market for $360,000 and I haven't been close to an offer yet. I'm happy just to turf it as I live in Canada and am just happy clearing debt now.

The rent was high at the time, and I fell for that "rent is just dead money, get a house and pay it off ASAP", but I would be light-years ahead financially had I paid that higher rent price.

Happily renting in Canada now, I'll buy again, but it's definitely taught me a lesson that you don't need to get into the market as soon as you can before you miss out! So many people tell me in this country that I need to buy something here as soon as I can, I tell them what I'm about to lose on my property in Australia, and they look at me like I'm speaking a different language.
I had about $11000 for my education (started 2006). At that time, that was enough for about 2 years of classes. I worked during school and graduated without debt and was still able to save up for a downpayment on a condo once I graduated. I lived at home so that obviously helped. 

I think it really depends on the child and their work ethic. If they are just going to coast by on my money, then I'm less willing to contribute. I still want them to work hard. We probably won't max our kids' RESP simply because we can't as daycare eats up so much of our income (3 kids 4 and under) but I'm hoping we can give them a good head start and the opportunity to graduate without debt.
I haven’t checked all of these but they should all have CDIC deposit insurance (except institutions in Manitoba that have provincial coverage, like Hubert). I deal with Hubert and EQ, they are both legit and have good service. If you dig further into the site, there are reviews and discussions on each bank.
Thought a higher ACB meant less total profit (ie. Buying stock A at $1 and selling at $10 for a taxable profit of $9 vs. DRIPping to an ACB of $5 and selling at $10 for a taxable profit of $5).  Basically I was affarid of how the DRIP significantly lowers the profit.  Even given this case, I feel you would still have higher profit as taxing $9 still ends up with more vs. $5 being taxed.
Foreign withholding is a small percentage of overall returns. It can be quite comfortably ignored. Sometimes this subreddit seems to put too much emphasis on it.

.

Anyway to answer some of your questions, the first thing you probably should understand is foreign withholding in a RRSP. The avoid it in a RRSP you need to directly hold stock or ETF's that are domiciled in the particular country. 

So to roughly means to avoid US dividend withholding you need to hold US stock or ETF's that trade on the US stock market in US dollars. Canadian ETFs or mutual funds that invest in the US will still have US dividend withholding in a RRSP. 

And this also means that it's not overly practical to avoid withholding from other international countries. Most Canadians aren't interested in buying stock or ETF's directly from stock exchanges outside of Canada and the US. The commissions tend to be quite high and the currency issues are annoying.

 They would instead prefer to buy Canadian mutual funds or ETF's that invest internationally. And these can't avoid foreign withholding in any type of account. 

. 

As for the actual mechanics of withholding it happens automatically when the dividend first crosses the border. You aren't involved in this in any way.

 If you are investing in a taxable account you'll get a tax slip for it. You enter that into your taxes and that's it. And in a registered account you'll get no slip and need to do nothing. 

. 

And in general there is no withholding on capital gains. It's just dividends and interest. 

. 

And to further emphasize what I said in the first paragraph, feel free to never think about foreign withholding again. You'll be fine not thinking about it.
Perhaps. She's only 6 right now.

We want to see what attitude she has before deciding if we'll pay for her university. We will likely talk to her about it but won't say how much is in it. We don't want her to grow up feeling like she's all set and doesn't need to work for her education
You can learn about anything that interests you, but are you not doing this in order to make some decision now?    So break down the decision tree and make each decision in order.     
* Have you made the choice between RRSP and TFSA?    
* Have you made a risk assessment and concluded that you want exposure to stocks and bonds vs HISA / GIC?   
* Do you understand how the prices of stocks and bonds move - what cause the moves, what range of outcomes are possible ... so confirm you still want to buy now.    
* Then research 'active vs passive investing' if you have not already been sold on passive indexing. Also learn about diversification.     
* Then learn about asset allocation, asset selection, rebalancing.  How much of this work do you want to do yourself, vs what is your top % to pay someone else to do it for you.        
* That decision decides which type of structure you want - individual stocks.bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, robo-advisors.
Thanks for the resource!

I don't recognize most of these. Are these legit institutions?
In this case, renting isn't the problem, the local market is.  It should be clear that real estate based on oil isn't a smart thing in the short term, and may be a problem in the long term.  That's the problem with alberta real estate.  Just invest in oil directly, less grief.

Toronto's not dependent on a single factor like that.  yes, I would suspect (in my completely uneducated opinion) that real estate there is more dependent on the economy in the long term.  So even if the market is high right now (arguable, everyone's predicting a crash, 11 times out of 10 they're right) and even if it crashes, I would expect it'll come back.
Would be better to educate on what an RESP is and the benefits, then to just spring it on them at the end. Have them "contribute" to it when they work, but stack the money into a savings account.
I am going university in the fall and my parents will be paying for everything. My mom comes from a culture where parents help out their adult children. My parents believe that post-secondary is extremely important and they are happy with what I am going to study. I understand that this degree takes lots of effort and will likely require post graduate education. Although I am not required to pay for my education I worked full time last summer, I have a job this summer and am planning to work in the summer in university. I believe that working is important to gain experience, develop work ethic and to make connections.
We're maxing her RESP. But won't tell her about it. We're going to wait and see what we think is best when she's older.
Considering that I get by (and comfortably so) on the equivalent of $24,000 a year, i wont be touching anything that arrogant sounding with a ten foot pole. I will never in my life see that kind of money movement. Most people won't.
What did you invest in to give you such poor returns?
