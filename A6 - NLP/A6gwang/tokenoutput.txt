Hello
all
.
I
just
recently
graduated
with
a
Master
's
degree
in
Physics
and
I
just
moved
to
a
new
city
to
become
a
data
scientist
.
I
'm
working
through
a
bootcamp
course
at
the
moment
.
I
do
n't
really
have
any
questions
as
I
do
n't
really
know
what
to
ask
,
but
I
figured
I
'd
throw
my
hat
in
the
ring
and
say
hello
.
I
suppose
if
anyone
has
any
general
tips
and
comments
that
's
always
appreciated
.
The
course
is
python
based
and
I
'll
be
learning
SQL
afterwards
as
it
seems
to
be
quite
important
.

I
am
extremely
opposed
to
the
general
philosophy
where
people
assume
that
their
effect
is
present
and
that
there
just
isn
‚Äô
t
enough
evidence
to
fully
support
it
.
They
are
asserting
the
alternative
hypothesis
after
rejecting
it
!
There
is
uncertainty
in
an
estimate
.
Adding
more
data
could
move
the
estimate
in
either
direction
,
so
instead
of
saying
that
it
is
trending
towards
significance
,
you
might
as
well
just
throw
out
the
hypothesis
test
and
say
whatever
the
fuck
you
want
.
Yeah
,
yeah
:
a
0.05
cutoff
is
arbitrary
,
but
the
whole
notion
of
‚Äú
we
tested
if
our
effect
was
different
from
zero
(
or
some
value
)
and
it
wasn
‚Äô
t
,
but
we
are
gon
na
go
ahead
and
say
it
is
,
assuming
we
got
more
data
that
worked
in
our
favor.

This
was
my
first

with

,
linear
regression
seemed
obviously
the
best

after
the
exploratory
data
analysis
but
I
also
decided
to
try
tree-based

just
to
test
their

accuracy
basically
.
I
kept
them
in

The

does
compromise
around

we
are
using
ml
algorithms

I
do
think
the

applies

,

I
would
be

to

not

As
for
this

I
was
a

constrained
on
what
data
to
use

the

dataset
does
contain
the

indeed
building
a
model
on

route
would
provide
interesting
results

I
started
my
job
as
a
data
scientist
nearly
3
months
ago
,
and
it
's
my
first
job
out
of
university
(
went
to
uni
and
also
work
in
the
UK
)
.
From
my
experience
from
being
balls
deep
in
the
job
search
after
university
,
I
would
say
there
is
a
lot
of
demand
for
data
scientists
but
unfortunately
,
the
vast
majority
of
listings
I
saw
usually
required
already
having
some
(
usually
3+
years
)
experience
as
a
data
scientist/quant
.
So
the
demand
is
there
but
the
hard
part
I
believe
is
getting
your
foot
through
the
door
.
Is
it
rewarding
?
I
would
say
so
.
Most
starting
salaries
I
've
seen
for
entry
level
data
scientist
roles
are
similar
to
that
for
an
actuarial
role
,
but
if
you
want
something
that
's
more
programming
focussed
,
I
'd
be
more
inclined
to
go
down
the
data
science
route
over
the
actuarial
one
.
I
've
seen
some
data
science
Jobs
requiring
5+
years
experience
offering
¬£100k+
,
so
the
earnings
potential
is
certainly
there
.
I
've
recently
read
that
your
long
term
earnings
potential
in
the
field
also
depends
on
other
factors
such
as
your
ability
to
manage
a
team
and
do
more
client
facing
work
,
which
may
vary
from
company
to
company
but
is
also
worth
noting
.
Whether
the
demand
for
one
is
more
than
the
other
I
'm
not
so
sure
,
but
I
do
know
that
both
are
in
demand
and
you
probably
wo
n't
go
far
wrong
by
becoming
an
Actuary
vs
becoming
a
data
scientist
.
I
have
noticed
a
significant
surge
in
the
data
science
field
though
,
and
machine
learning/AI
is
still
a
fast-growing
area
of
research

A
general
data
science
courses
do
offer
a
good
overlap
between
Stats
and
CS
.
But
there
is
some
problem
with
them
.
They
are
not
mature
enough
yet
.
Lots
are
created
to
fill
the
hype
and
buzz
around
the
exciting
world
of
data
science
.
It
may
mature
,
but
not
yet
.
Why
would
I
recommend
the
regular
degree
like
stats
is
it
offers
deeper
understanding
of
the
subject
-
preparing
you
to
'Think
in
stats
'
.
Maching
learning
in
many
ways
is
just
stats
from
the
point
of
view
of
CS
.
We
can
learn
and
master
machine
learning
easier
when
we
have
already
master
stats
.
This
brings
me
to
the
my
important
point
.
When
you
're
encountering
uncharted
territory
,
some
unfamiliar
data
science
problem
,
what
will
you
do
?
Can
the
Master
is
Data
science
course
prepares
you
for
that
?
It
will
if
the
curriculum
is
deep
enough
.
Then
,
it
is
good
.
But
I
doubt
it
when
the
course
is
built
upon
many
different
unrelated
modules
bound
into
one
.
A
good
understanding
of
core
subject
like
stats
prepares
you
for
the
unfamiliar
.
It
offer
a
good
grasp
of
the
subject
that
instead
of
just
being
data
science
tools
user
,
you
can
dwelve
into
becoming
a
creator
.
Having
said
all
this
,
if
you
do
master
in
stats
,
you
still
need
to
prepare
to
learn
a
lot
more
after
finishing
your
degree
.
But
things
would
be
easier
to
learn
because
you
have
the
basic
foundation
.
If
you
do
the
mixed-up
degree
in
data
science
,
there
is
a
good
chance
that
you
can
only
apply
what
you
've
learnt
,
as
your
foundation
is
not
strong
enough
to
dig
deeper
.

n't
think
I
'd
go
with
an
external
dataset
purely
because
I
've
so
far
seen
too
many
different
email
organizations
,
so
what
you
define
as
intent
might
differ
from
your
colleagues
and
it
might
differ
from
other
datasets
.
The
previous
time
I
was
asked
to
do
this
i
had
it
easier
since
people
were
already
dragging
and
dropping
emails
to
specific
subfolders
so
that
created
my
labeled
data
.

This
is
really
a

question
.
You
should
at

google
around
for
directories
or
databases
of
business
listings
.
If
all
else
fails
just
scrape
yelp
.
Later
on
,
to
use
google
's
api
,
keep
in
mind
you
'll
need
to
sign
up
for
an
account
with
the
google
maps
api
and
also
link
it
to
a
credit
card
(
but
they
wo
n't
charge
you
if
you

If

I

If

CS/MLE/DS

My

that
80-90

CS

already
have

Author

MLTyrunt
Body
:
Usually
predictive
analytics
are
more
closely
associated
with
DS
than
BI
.
BI
is
said
to
be
predominantly
about
records
of
the
past
and
the
present
,
DS
to
be
about
extrapolation
to
the
future
using
ML
.
BIs
Data
warehousing
and
reporting
are
not
so
much
about
inventing
novel
,
predictive
data
products
which
add
value
in
innovative
ways
.
DS
is
in
my
point
of
view
different
from
BI
,
and
requires
a
different
,
more
programming-savy
and
creative
skillset
than
BI
.
DS
is
already
rebranded
since
a
couple
of
years
,
the
fuzz
is
now
about
AI
and
machine
learning
engineering
.
More
complex
techniques
as
reinforcement
learning
are
productionized
.
Not
all
predictive
analytics
professionals
have
the
skills
to
go
more
far
than
usual
supervised
and
unsupervised
learning
kaggle
competition
stuff
,
so
I
guess
ML
engineering
will
become
a
subfield
in
data
science
recognized
in
its
own
right
.
Then
again
,
all
this
terminology
is
not
well
defined
anyway
,
I
only
try
to
tap
some
tendencies
here
.

if

a

a

publish

Second
:
geocoding
addresses
is
a
pain
,
especially
if
not
formatted
well

SAS
has
street
level
geocoding
for
US
,
as
long
as
you
have
full
version
.
Most
unis
have
licenses
.
You
can
use
Google
maps
for
this
but
they
have
a
low
limit
,
and
you
only
get
about
200
worth
of
credits
a
month
.
You
can
burn
through
that
pretty
quickly
.
And
-
see
if
your
state
or
city
has
an
business
license
database
publicly
available
.
That
usually
has
all
the
information
already

How

something

something
that
‚Äô

know

a
hiring
manager
.
Are
they
the
person
who
Googles
first
,
remembers
to
ask
for
help
,
only
asks
for
answers
and
never
tries
to
solve
something
on
their
own
,
try
to
solve
it
,
or
gives
up
.
This
can
happen
a
lot
in
the
early
days
of
a
job
and
someone
who
doesn
‚Äô
t
know
how
to
gracefully
deal
with
the
unknown
is
definitely
at
a
beginner
level
.

a

you

where
Xi
is
5
standard
deviations
away
from
the
center

I
think
your

more
or
less
``

It

not

depending

if
you

Hey
all
(
and
practicing
Data
Scientists
in
particular
)
,
I
'm
currently
enrolled
in
a
DS
bootcamp
and
looking
for
ideas
for
my
first
Capstone
project
.
I
have
a
data
set
that
I
'd
really
like
to
use
,
but
I
'm
not
sure
what
the
best
thing
to
do
with
it
would
be
.
I
would
love
some
input
from
you
all
!
The
data
set
is
3
years
(
'16-'18
)
of
test
results
for
the
New
York
State
mathematics
exam
for
grades
3-8
(
found
here
:
https
:
//data.nysed.gov/downloads.php
)
.
The
files
have
all
elementary
and
middles
schools
of
every
county
in
NYS
,
with
student
performance
on
the
exam
(
aggregated
by
grade
level
)
.
Student
performance
is
measured
in
Levels
,
1-4
.
Even
though
individual
student
results
are
n't
included
,
I
think
this
data
set
is
really
interesting
and
would
love
to
use
it
for
my
project
.
My
initial
thought
is
to
do
some
sort
of
regression
analysis
to
predict
a
particular
school
's
or
district
's
performance
in
future
years
,
but
I
do
n't
know
if
3
years
of
data
is
enough
for
this
.
Data
sets
dating
back
from
2006
also
exist
,
but
do
n't
break
down
to
individual
counties/schools
like
16-18
do
.
Anyone
have
any
thoughts
on
what
else
I
might
be
able
to
do
?
?
?
Appreciate
the
help
!

If
you

I

incline

doing

pick
up
machine

'll

I
suggest
stats
as
we

have
to
strong
understanding

it

go
further
in

If

then
master

PhD
in

unsatisfactory

the

Purely
because
you
've
mentioned
that
the
question
has
a
time
component
,
I
'd
share
your
caution
about
using
a
decision
tree
because
it
ca
n't
take
that
into
account
.
If
you
do
end
up
switching
models
,
I
'd
look
into
FB
's
[
prophet
]
(
https
:
//research.fb.com/prophet-forecasting-at-scale/
)
model
or
anything
forecast
based
over
ML
based
purely
so
that
you
can
take
the
seasonality
into
account
-
most
businesses
are
going
to
have
months
that
perform
differently
to
others
with
some
regularity
.
You
could
also
look
into
Hyndman
's
Forecasting
Principles
&
Practice
if
this
is
something
you
do
regularly
as
he
has
a
lot
of
good
start
points
and
did
the
forecast
library
in
R.
But
without
a
great
deal
of
information
about
why
the
model
is
n't
performing
well
,
it
's
difficult
to
know
if
it
's
performing
badly
because
it
's
not
well
suited
to
the
problem
-
maybe
they
do
n't
have
a
great
deal
of
seasonality
and
my
comments
about
forecasting
are
way
off
.
I
've
done
an
end
of
day
model
revenue
forecaster
using
xgboost
in
the
past
that
mostly
took
lagged
factors
into
account
-
adding
expected
conversion
rates
for
previous
days
&
weeks
helped
considerably
,
as
did
adding
in
combination
effects
by
testing
the
multiplication
&
addition
of
numeric
fields
,
as
a
decision
tree
is
unable
to
consider
multiple
columns
at
once
otherwise
.
(
Edit
;
I
had
a
look
at
the
ML
subreddit
and
they
had
a
really
good
recent
post
about
https
:
//www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/amj60h/d_what_are_some_modern_machine_learning/
-
they
mostly
go
down
for
Prophet
and
LSTMs
.
I
'd
go
with
Prophet
first
,
it
's
SO
interpretable
and
friendly
to
use
,
but
they
also
talk
about
XGBoost
in
some
detail

Aside

During

I
started

what

far
was
the
tip

To
be
honest

I
felt
that
most
interviews
were
very
straight
forward
with
what
you
find
if
you
google
``
data
science
interview
questions
''
.
However
this
does
not
mean
they
were
n't
difficult
-
many
questions
involved
machine
learning
,
such
as
``
how
does
random
forest
work
?
What
is
L1
L2
regularization
?
Explain
what
XGBoost
is
.
''
Lots
of
time
was
also
spent
talking
about
my
personal
projects
in
school
,
why
I
chose
certain
methods
,
etc

Towards
the
beginning
my
nerves
got
the
best
of
me
and
I
would
blank
out

explain
something
very
poorly

I
took
each
failure
as
a
motivator
to
keep

rehearsing
answers

I
started
off
in
Excel
too

found
that
R
and
Python
can
do
things
much
quicker
and
better
than
Excel
.
I
would
try

take
some
time
to
learn
R
with
Tidyverse
(
a
library
within

Tidyverse
is
used
for

is
very

I
myself
started
off
with
Python
but
both
have
their
advantages

Lastly
,
on
my
resume
I
listed
4
projects
.
2
projects
involved
a
topic
I
was
interested
in
,
where
I
designed
a

process
from
end
to
end

1
project
involved
a
common
real
world
scenario
-
ML
with
customer
segmentation
(
trying
to
find
potential
customers
.
)
My
final
project
involved
statistical
modeling
and
inference
.
I
chose
these
4
out
of
all
my
projects
in

because
I
felt

If

This
works
well
if

again

It
‚Äô
s

to
do
this
every

so
you

I

the
way
I
asked
this

kind

weird

Anyways
,
real

data
follows
some
joint
distribution
.
And
some
data
points
might
lie
on
the
slightly
far
end
of
that
distribution
so
that
they
are
rare
,
but
still
possible
(
like
3
sds
away
from
the
median
)
.
Your
training
data
might
well
represent
the
``
true
''
distribution
but
up
to
3
sds
back
and
front
.
In
that
case
,
extrapolation
might
still
happen
.
Would
you
still
call
this
sample
bias
?

of
learning
SAS
(
a
fairly
common
statistical
analysis
tool
)
.
The
added
benefit
is
that
SAS
supports
SQL
,
albeit
with
a
few
minor
differences
in
syntax
.
I
also
took
a
Database
Management
course
at
my
local
Community
College
to
establish
a
foundational
understanding
of
how
databases
work
.
The
course
leaned
exclusively
on
SQL
as
the
query
language
.
I
also
took
some
formalized
SAS
training
through
the
SAS
company
.
I
've
done
quite
a
bit
of
self
study
and
am
working
my
way
through
Data
Science
for
Business
.
I
've
heard
a
lot
of
great
things
about
this
book
and
I
'm
about
half-way
done
with
it
.
It
seems
to
be
a
great
introduction
to
the
many
concepts
within
Data
Science
.
It
's
not
overly
technical
but
it
should
give
you
an
idea
of
where
you
might
have
an
interest
in
focusing
.
I
also
took
a
Java
course
to
boost
my
understanding
of
object-oriented
programming
.
I
am
self-taught
on
VBA/Excel
which
was
my
introduction
to
programming
and
how
I
stepped
away
from
Excel
by
leveraging
macros
to
get
into
programming
.
I
would
n't
necessarily
recommend
VBA
unless
you
have
plans
to
remain
at
a
company
that
relies
heavily
on
Excel
without
access
to
many
other
data
analysis
tools
.
I
've
noticed
a
lot
of
positions
within
my
company
(
Bank
)
look
for
R
,
Python
or
SAS
.
I
've
dabbled
a
bit
with
Python
and
it
seems
very
easy
to
pickup
.
I
recommend
learning
Python
.
There
are
a
lot
of
great
books
out
there
though
I
ca
n't
vouch
for
one
in
particular
.
I
think
it
's
important
to
understand
SQL
as
it
's
somewhat
of
a
safety
net
in
that
you
will
be
able
to
directly
query
many/most
data
sources
with
SQL
.
However
,
keep
your
eye
on
the
future
and
what
languages/tools
businesses
will
be
looking
for
,
e.g
.
Python
.
Do
n't
forget
,
these
languages
are
simply
intended
to
facilitate
application
of
statistical
concepts
.
Without
a
fundamental
understanding
of
these
concepts
you
're
going
to
be
at
a
disadvantage
.
So
,
my
strongest
recommendation
would
be
to
ensure
your
Stats
is
up
to
par
.
I
self-studied
+
took
a
course
utilizing
the
book
Elementary
Statistics
by
Treola
.
It
's
a
wonderful
book
and
slightly
less
dry
than
others
I
've
tried
.
I
've
also
heard
great
things
about
Naked
Statistics
.
Best
of
luck
and
feel
free
to
reach
out/PM
with
any
questions
!

I
see
above
that
you
say
you
have
a
500
K
row
dataset
,
and
that
the
algorithm
is
slow
.
Have
you
extracted
first
the
column
with
the
names
to
work
it
alone
?
Also
,
500
K
rows
is
nothing
for
SQL
.
You
could
dump
the
data
in
a
SQL
table
so
you
have
some
sort
of
id
(
In
order
to
shove
back
)
and
the
names
.
You
then
start
by
cleaning
by
hand
(
For
instance
,
removing
places
where
there
are
more
thna
1
space
to
a
single
one
,
trimming
spaces
from
the
ends
if
they
exists
,
etc
)
You
then
use
simple
SQL
queries
to
replace
wrong
names
for
right
ones
,
and
once
you
're
happy
with
your
data
you
shove
it
back
.

As
a
first
advice
,
I
'd
say
to
create
a
frequency
table
of
all
the
names
,
and
see
what
's
there
.
Unfortunatelly
for
this
kind
of
issues
there
's
nothing
available
but
brute
force
.
You
might
have
to
code
case
for
case
;
but
then
having
a
good
overview
of
how
big
the
problem
is
will
be
a
good
starting
point
.

Congrats
on
the
job
.
I
am
going
through
the
same
process
myself
.
Currently
doing
my
masters
in
data
analytics
and
I
can
relate
to
the
rejections
as
I
am
new
to
the
field
as
well
.
Your
story
has
given
me
inspiration
and
hope

Why
so
?
For
example
I
do
n't
prefer
pie
charts
and
try
to
look
for
other
ways
of
representations
.
Since
it
's
difficult
for
human
eyes
to
judge
the
distribution
of
data
from
pies
.
