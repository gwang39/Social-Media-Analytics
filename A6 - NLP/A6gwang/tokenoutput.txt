Hello
all
.
I
just
recently
graduated
with
a
Master
's
degree
in
Physics
and
I
just
moved
to
a
new
city
to
become
a
data
scientist
.
I
'm
working
through
a
bootcamp
course
at
the
moment
.
I
do
n't
really
have
any
questions
as
I
do
n't
really
know
what
to
ask
,
but
I
figured
I
'd
throw
my
hat
in
the
ring
and
say
hello
.
I
suppose
if
anyone
has
any
general
tips
and
comments
that
's
always
appreciated
.
The
course
is
python
based
and
I
'll
be
learning
SQL
afterwards
as
it
seems
to
be
quite
important
.

I
am
extremely
opposed
to
the
general
philosophy
where
people
assume
that
their
effect
is
present
and
that
there
just
isn
’
t
enough
evidence
to
fully
support
it
.
They
are
asserting
the
alternative
hypothesis
after
rejecting
it
!
There
is
uncertainty
in
an
estimate
.
Adding
more
data
could
move
the
estimate
in
either
direction
,
so
instead
of
saying
that
it
is
trending
towards
significance
,
you
might
as
well
just
throw
out
the
hypothesis
test
and
say
whatever
the
fuck
you
want
.
Yeah
,
yeah
:
a
0.05
cutoff
is
arbitrary
,
but
the
whole
notion
of
“
we
tested
if
our
effect
was
different
from
zero
(
or
some
value
)
and
it
wasn
’
t
,
but
we
are
gon
na
go
ahead
and
say
it
is
,
assuming
we
got
more
data
that
worked
in
our
favor.

crazy
part
is

rampant
this
is

This
was
my
first
project
with
spark
,
linear
regression
seemed
obviously
the
best

algorithm
after
the
exploratory
data
analysis
but
I
also
decided
to
try
tree-based

just
to
test
their

accuracy
basically
.
I
kept
them
in

The

does
compromise
around
20

we
are
using
ml
algorithms
so
I
do
think
the

applies
well

,

I
would
be

to

not

As
for
this

I
was
a

constrained
on
what
data
to
use

the

dataset
does
contain
the
destination

indeed
building
a
model
on

specific
route
would
provide
interesting
results

I
started
my
job
as
a
data
scientist
nearly
3
months
ago
,
and
it
's
my
first
job
out
of
university
(
went
to
uni
and
also
work
in
the
UK
)
.
From
my
experience
from
being
balls
deep
in
the
job
search
after
university
,
I
would
say
there
is
a
lot
of
demand
for
data
scientists
but
unfortunately
,
the
vast
majority
of
listings
I
saw
usually
required
already
having
some
(
usually
3+
years
)
experience
as
a
data
scientist/quant
.
So
the
demand
is
there
but
the
hard
part
I
believe
is
getting
your
foot
through
the
door
.
Is
it
rewarding
?
I
would
say
so
.
Most
starting
salaries
I
've
seen
for
entry
level
data
scientist
roles
are
similar
to
that
for
an
actuarial
role
,
but
if
you
want
something
that
's
more
programming
focussed
,
I
'd
be
more
inclined
to
go
down
the
data
science
route
over
the
actuarial
one
.
I
've
seen
some
data
science
Jobs
requiring
5+
years
experience
offering
£100k+
,
so
the
earnings
potential
is
certainly
there
.
I
've
recently
read
that
your
long
term
earnings
potential
in
the
field
also
depends
on
other
factors
such
as
your
ability
to
manage
a
team
and
do
more
client
facing
work
,
which
may
vary
from
company
to
company
but
is
also
worth
noting
.
Whether
the
demand
for
one
is
more
than
the
other
I
'm
not
so
sure
,
but
I
do
know
that
both
are
in
demand
and
you
probably
wo
n't
go
far
wrong
by
becoming
an
Actuary
vs
becoming
a
data
scientist
.
I
have
noticed
a
significant
surge
in
the
data
science
field
though
,
and
machine
learning/AI
is
still
a
fast-growing
area
of
research

A
general
data
science
courses
do
offer
a
good
overlap
between
Stats
and
CS
.
But
there
is
some
problem
with
them
.
They
are
not
mature
enough
yet
.
Lots
are
created
to
fill
the
hype
and
buzz
around
the
exciting
world
of
data
science
.
It
may
mature
,
but
not
yet
.
Why
would
I
recommend
the
regular
degree
like
stats
is
it
offers
deeper
understanding
of
the
subject
-
preparing
you
to
'Think
in
stats
'
.
Maching
learning
in
many
ways
is
just
stats
from
the
point
of
view
of
CS
.
We
can
learn
and
master
machine
learning
easier
when
we
have
already
master
stats
.
This
brings
me
to
the
my
important
point
.
When
you
're
encountering
uncharted
territory
,
some
unfamiliar
data
science
problem
,
what
will
you
do
?
Can
the
Master
is
Data
science
course
prepares
you
for
that
?
It
will
if
the
curriculum
is
deep
enough
.
Then
,
it
is
good
.
But
I
doubt
it
when
the
course
is
built
upon
many
different
unrelated
modules
bound
into
one
.
A
good
understanding
of
core
subject
like
stats
prepares
you
for
the
unfamiliar
.
It
offer
a
good
grasp
of
the
subject
that
instead
of
just
being
data
science
tools
user
,
you
can
dwelve
into
becoming
a
creator
.
Having
said
all
this
,
if
you
do
master
in
stats
,
you
still
need
to
prepare
to
learn
a
lot
more
after
finishing
your
degree
.
But
things
would
be
easier
to
learn
because
you
have
the
basic
foundation
.
If
you
do
the
mixed-up
degree
in
data
science
,
there
is
a
good
chance
that
you
can
only
apply
what
you
've
learnt
,
as
your
foundation
is
not
strong
enough
to
dig
deeper
.

seen
too
many

email
organizations
,
so
what
you
define
as
intent
might
differ
from
your
colleagues
and
it
might
differ
from
other
datasets
.
The
previous
time
I
was
asked
to
do
this
i
had
it
easier
since
people
were
already
dragging

dropping
emails
to

that
created
my

This
is
really
a
basic
question
.
You
should
at
least
google
around
for
directories
or
databases
of
business
listings
.
If
all
else
fails
just
scrape
yelp
.
Later
on
,
to
use
google
's
api
,
keep
in
mind
you
'll
need
to
sign
up
for
an
account
with
the
google
maps
api
and
also
link
it
to
a
credit
card
(
but
they
wo
n't
charge
you
if
you
sign
up
for
the

)
.
If
that
's
too
troublesome
just
use
one
of
the
many
other

If

CS/MLE/DS

My

that
80-90

engineering

CS

already
have
an

Author

Body
:
Usually
predictive
analytics
are
more
closely
associated
with
DS
than
BI
.
BI
is
said
to
be
predominantly
about
records
of
the
past
and
the
present
,
DS
to
be
about
extrapolation
to
the
future
using
ML
.
BIs
Data
warehousing
and
reporting
are
not
so
much
about
inventing
novel
,
predictive
data
products
which
add
value
in
innovative
ways
.
DS
is
in
my
point
of
view
different
from
BI
,
and
requires
a
different
,
more
programming-savy
and
creative
skillset
than
BI
.
DS
is
already
rebranded
since
a
couple
of
years
,
the
fuzz
is
now
about
AI
and
machine
learning
engineering
.
More
complex
techniques
as
reinforcement
learning
are
productionized
.
Not
all
predictive
analytics
professionals
have
the
skills
to
go
more
far
than
usual
supervised
and
unsupervised
learning
kaggle
competition
stuff
,
so
I
guess
ML
engineering
will
become
a
subfield
in
data
science
recognized
in
its
own
right
.
Then
again
,
all
this
terminology
is
not
well
defined
anyway
,
I
only
try
to
tap
some
tendencies
here
.

Right

theres
a

Second
:
geocoding

a
pain

if

SAS
has
street

geocoding
for

as
long

Most

have

You
can
use
Google

for
this
but
they
have
a
low
limit
,
and
you
only
get
about
200
worth
of
credits
a
month
.
You
can
burn
through
that
pretty
quickly
.
And
-
see
if
your
state
or

has
an
business
license
database
publicly
available
.
That
usually
has
all
the
information
already

How

something

something
that

hiring
manager

Are
they
the
person
who
Googles
first
,
remembers
to
ask
for
help
,
only
asks
for
answers
and
never
tries
to
solve
something
on
their
own
,
try
to
solve
it
,
or
gives
up
.
This
can
happen
a
lot
in
the
early
days
of
a
job
and
someone
who
doesn
’
t
know
how
to
gracefully
deal
with
the
unknown
is
definitely
at
a
beginner
level

a

you

5
standard

I

your

more

less
``

It

although
I
do
have

May
be
the

between

or
not
,
depending
on
what

you
're

but
if
you

I

Hey
all
(
and
practicing
Data
Scientists
in
particular
)
,
I
'm
currently
enrolled
in
a
DS
bootcamp
and
looking
for
ideas
for
my
first
Capstone
project
.
I
have
a
data
set
that
I
'd
really
like
to
use
,
but
I
'm
not
sure
what
the
best
thing
to
do
with
it
would
be
.
I
would
love
some
input
from
you
all
!
The
data
set
is
3
years
(
'16-'18
)
of
test
results
for
the
New
York
State
mathematics
exam
for
grades
3-8
(
found
here
:
https
:
//data.nysed.gov/downloads.php
)
.
The
files
have
all
elementary
and
middles
schools
of
every
county
in
NYS
,
with
student
performance
on
the
exam
(
aggregated
by
grade
level
)
.
Student
performance
is
measured
in
Levels
,
1-4
.
Even
though
individual
student
results
are
n't
included
,
I
think
this
data
set
is
really
interesting
and
would
love
to
use
it
for
my
project
.
My
initial
thought
is
to
do
some
sort
of
regression
analysis
to
predict
a
particular
school
's
or
district
's
performance
in
future
years
,
but
I
do
n't
know
if
3
years
of
data
is
enough
for
this
.
Data
sets
dating
back
from
2006
also
exist
,
but
do
n't
break
down
to
individual
counties/schools
like
16-18
do
.
Anyone
have
any
thoughts
on
what
else
I
might
be
able
to
do
?
?
?
Appreciate
the
help
!

Get

If
you
can

one
I
am
more
incline
to
suggest
to

doing

pick
up
machine
learning

the
course

you
'll

use
to

I
suggest
stats
as
we
need
to
have
to
strong
understanding
of
it
to
go
further
in
machine
learning
modeling

If

then
master
in

and
PhD
in

quite
big

realizing

indeed
unsatisfactory

the

Purely
because
you
've
mentioned
that
the
question
has
a
time
component
,
I
'd
share
your
caution
about
using
a
decision
tree
because
it
ca
n't
take
that
into
account
.
If
you
do
end
up
switching
models
,
I
'd
look
into
FB
's
[
prophet
]
(
https
:
//research.fb.com/prophet-forecasting-at-scale/
)
model
or
anything
forecast
based
over
ML
based
purely
so
that
you
can
take
the
seasonality
into
account
-
most
businesses
are
going
to
have
months
that
perform
differently
to
others
with
some
regularity
.
You
could
also
look
into
Hyndman
's
Forecasting
Principles
&
Practice
if
this
is
something
you
do
regularly
as
he
has
a
lot
of
good
start
points
and
did
the
forecast
library
in
R.
But
without
a
great
deal
of
information
about
why
the
model
is
n't
performing
well
,
it
's
difficult
to
know
if
it
's
performing
badly
because
it
's
not
well
suited
to
the
problem
-
maybe
they
do
n't
have
a
great
deal
of
seasonality
and
my
comments
about
forecasting
are
way
off
.
I
've
done
an
end
of
day
model
revenue
forecaster
using
xgboost
in
the
past
that
mostly
took
lagged
factors
into
account
-
adding
expected
conversion
rates
for
previous
days
&
weeks
helped
considerably
,
as
did
adding
in
combination
effects
by
testing
the
multiplication
&
addition
of
numeric
fields
,
as
a
decision
tree
is
unable
to
consider
multiple
columns
at
once
otherwise
.
(
Edit
;
I
had
a
look
at
the
ML
subreddit
and
they
had
a
really
good
recent
post
about
https
:
//www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/amj60h/d_what_are_some_modern_machine_learning/
-
they
mostly
go
down
for
Prophet
and
LSTMs
.
I
'd
go
with
Prophet
first
,
it
's
SO
interpretable
and
friendly
to
use
,
but
they
also
talk
about
XGBoost
in
some
detail

During

I
was

It

I
started
interviewing

far
was
the
tip

To
be
honest
,
I
felt
that
most
interviews
were
very
straight
forward
with
what
you
find
if
you
google
``
data
science
interview
questions
''
.
However
this
does
not
mean
they
were
n't
difficult
-
many
questions
involved
machine
learning
,
such
as
``
how
does
random
forest
work
?
What
is
L1
L2
regularization
?
Explain
what
XGBoost
is
.
''
Lots
of
time
was
also
spent
talking
about
my
personal
projects
in
school
,
why
I
chose
certain
methods
,
etc
.
Towards
the
beginning
my
nerves
got
the
best
of
me
and
I
would
blank
out
or
explain
something
very
poorly

but
I
took
each
failure
as
a
motivator
to
keep
on
practicing
and
rehearsing
answers
in

I
started
off
in

found
that
R

Python
can
do
things
much
quicker

better
than
Excel

I

take
some

to
learn
R
with
Tidyverse

a

Tidyverse

I
myself
started
off
with

both
have
their

Lastly
,
on

I
listed
4
projects

2
projects
involved
a
topic
I
was
interested

where
I
designed

from

1
project
involved
a
common
real
world
scenario
-
ML
with
customer
segmentation
(
trying
to
find
potential
customers
.
)
My
final
project
involved
statistical
modeling
and
inference
.
I
chose
these
4
out
of
all
my

in

I

This
works
well
if

again

It
’
s
tedious
to
do
this
every
time

so
you

I

the
way
I

this

kind

weird

Anyways
,
real

data
follows
some
joint
distribution

And
some
data
points
might
lie
on
the
slightly
far
end
of
that
distribution
so
that
they
are
rare
,
but
still
possible
(
like
3
sds
away
from
the
median
)
.
Your
training
data
might
well
represent
the
``
true
''
distribution
but
up
to
3
sds
back
and
front
.
In
that
case
,
extrapolation
might
still
happen
.
Would
you
still
call
this
sample
bias
?

.
The
course
leaned
exclusively
on
SQL
as
the
query
language
.
I
also
took
some
formalized
SAS
training
through
the
SAS
company
.
I
've
done
quite
a
bit
of
self
study
and
am
working
my
way
through
Data
Science
for
Business
.
I
've
heard
a
lot
of
great
things
about
this
book
and
I
'm
about
half-way
done
with
it
.
It
seems
to
be
a
great
introduction
to
the
many
concepts
within
Data
Science
.
It
's
not
overly
technical
but
it
should
give
you
an
idea
of
where
you
might
have
an
interest
in
focusing
.
I
also
took
a
Java
course
to
boost
my
understanding
of
object-oriented
programming
.
I
am
self-taught
on
VBA/Excel
which
was
my
introduction
to
programming
and
how
I
stepped
away
from
Excel
by
leveraging
macros
to
get
into
programming
.
I
would
n't
necessarily
recommend
VBA
unless
you
have
plans
to
remain
at
a
company
that
relies
heavily
on
Excel
without
access
to
many
other
data
analysis
tools
.
I
've
noticed
a
lot
of
positions
within
my
company
(
Bank
)
look
for
R
,
Python
or
SAS
.
I
've
dabbled
a
bit
with
Python
and
it
seems
very
easy
to
pickup
.
I
recommend
learning
Python
.
There
are
a
lot
of
great
books
out
there
though
I
ca
n't
vouch
for
one
in
particular
.
I
think
it
's
important
to
understand
SQL
as
it
's
somewhat
of
a
safety
net
in
that
you
will
be
able
to
directly
query
many/most
data
sources
with
SQL
.
However
,
keep
your
eye
on
the
future
and
what
languages/tools
businesses
will
be
looking
for
,
e.g
.
Python
.
Do
n't
forget
,
these
languages
are
simply
intended
to
facilitate
application
of
statistical
concepts
.
Without
a
fundamental
understanding
of
these
concepts
you
're
going
to
be
at
a
disadvantage
.
So
,
my
strongest
recommendation
would
be
to
ensure
your
Stats
is
up
to
par
.
I
self-studied
+
took
a
course
utilizing
the
book
Elementary
Statistics
by
Treola
.
It
's
a
wonderful
book
and
slightly
less
dry
than
others
I
've
tried
.
I
've
also
heard
great
things
about
Naked
Statistics
.
Best
of
luck
and
feel
free
to
reach
out/PM
with
any
questions
!

I
see
above
that
you
say
you
have
a
500
K
row
dataset
,
and
that
the
algorithm
is
slow
.
Have
you
extracted
first
the
column
with
the
names
to
work
it
alone
?
Also
,
500
K
rows
is
nothing
for
SQL
.
You
could
dump
the
data
in
a
SQL
table
so
you
have
some
sort
of
id
(
In
order
to
shove
back
)
and
the
names
.
You
then
start
by
cleaning
by
hand
(
For
instance
,
removing
places
where
there
are
more
thna
1
space
to
a
single
one
,
trimming
spaces
from
the
ends
if
they
exists
,
etc
)
You
then
use
simple
SQL
queries
to
replace
wrong
names
for
right
ones
,
and
once
you
're
happy
with
your
data
you
shove
it
back
.

As
a
first
advice
,
I
'd
say
to
create
a
frequency
table
of
all
the
names
,
and
see
what
's
there
.
Unfortunatelly
for
this
kind
of
issues
there
's
nothing
available
but
brute
force
.
You
might
have
to
code
case
for
case
;
but
then
having
a
good
overview
of
how
big
the
problem
is
will
be
a
good
starting
point
.

Congrats
on
the
job
.
I
am
going
through
the
same
process
myself
.
Currently
doing
my
masters
in
data
analytics
and
I
can
relate
to
the
rejections
as
I
am
new
to
the
field
as
well
.
Your
story
has
given
me
inspiration
and
hope
.

Why
so
?
For
example
I
do
n't
prefer
pie
charts
and
try
to
look
for
other
ways
of
representations
.
Since
it
's
difficult
for
human
eyes
to
judge
the
distribution
of
data
from
pies
.
