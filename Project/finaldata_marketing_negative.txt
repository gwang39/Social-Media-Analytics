As such, I'm looking for someone who either has business contacts or possess good marketing skills to promote my services to potential clients. *Please note that this isn't a job with a fixed rate; rather, we will share the payment after a project is completed.*
Hi - I am looking to fill a Marketo Specialist role in the Philadelphia, PA area.  It's a long term (1-2 year), full time contract.   Pay is in the $60/hour range, but can be higher for the right individual.   DM me resumes or questions!  Thanks.
They also have a Facebook Group full of marketing pros that has been really helpful to me in the past when I need recommendations or advice.

Audiences are tired of being blasted sales or always being told what to do. Make things organic and find ways to connect with your audience. Engage with your followers and see what they like, don't like and what they do other then listen to your music.
Now it's time to start focusing on the audience, who they are and what they like
And remember, you are listening but not listening too hard.
The audience should never totally dictate what your brand does unless that is in your marketing strategy.
When I look at the top ranking pages, this seems to be an informational search. Did you create the best guide for opening your pool in spring, yet? If not, do not bother with optimizing the page. You need to create the right content first.
If this AMP implementation is here to stay, no idea. But building know how now will not hurt. I would put 5% of my SEO effort into this and see if there is any traffic to get.
I started making way more money after becoming a consultant and charging on % ad spend for this reason.
I work in this field and I do not get a percentage of increased revenue.  I optimize the full funnel though and there are so many people and processes involved it would be unfair to say that I should get a cut of increases and not everyone else involved.  I believe I am well compensated through the standard bonus structure plus I like the stability.  What you’re describing is a sales style compensation model which can have big booms and busts that are often frankly out of your control.
Normally performances based bonuses have a number of goals (like +x% ROAS, +y% conversation rate in segment z, etc.) tied to a fixed amount of money.
My agency charges % of ad spend and then I get a salary that never budges, even when spend scales hundreds of thousands of dollars. 🙃 never heard of getting %of revenue increases in performance marketing though.
only drawback of iPad is that not all tools are well optimized for iPad. I have been using an iPad for years now  but a decent 2-in-1 12-13 inch laptop should get the job done.
SEMRush and Search Console, although neither will help much if the site doesnt rank for anything.
I’ve had to train clients. No vertical video, focus, etc. i ask them to take “too many” and usually get 1-3 that work.
I’ve worked at 2 different agencies and neither offered photography/videography services. Does your agency only work with local businesses? In my experience, almost all of my clients were located far enough away that this wouldn’t be feasible.
I take photos and video as part of my services, the cost gets factored into the overall price.  It was frustrating for both me and my clients trying to get them to take acceptable photos / video as most have nothing more than their cell phone and don't understand proper lighting techniques.
What does the contract say?
This is typically an upsell. Last agency I worked with had a X fee per creative built into their contract
If not, DMA can have a list of partner photographers. It’s a win win. Photographer gets more gig from DMA and DMA can demand some discount so that they can show value to the Client.
Third way is to hire an in house photographer if you have such high demand. 
In my opinion, it’s better if DMA controls the photography needs of the client’s campaign. It would be a shame to watch bad photo from a client break DMA’s advertising effort.
What is the content? Video, image, blog, social post?
SEMrush has a plagiarism checker with their SEO Writing Assistant tool.
You will find freelance work without experience if you work hard for it. And it might suck at the beginning: things will be harder than you thought and you won't know how to communicate with your first client or what to say but it's normal, just don't give up.
There are a bunch of other platforms out there you can try I am personally working on PeoplePerHour and I think it's better suited for you as a beginner because they have a system that encourages new freelancers to apply and find jobs and they offer free proposals you could use to apply to projects as opposed to Upwork who charge even for that.
You also need to understand that freelance success isn't much about skills but really about good communication and going the extra mile to help the clients solve their problems.
But don't sell yourself too short. Not all clients are equal. Some cheap clients you want to avoid because they're toxic and will suck life out of you avoid them at all cost. Know what the type of clients you want to work with. Attract them and build longlasting relationships with them
Why would someone pay you?
I got my first copywriting job on Upwork without any experience. It was a $30 job for a blog post. It took me about 1-2 weeks to get my first client.
1) Your profile
At this point, you could have the best profile in the world but it doesn't mean anything until you get reviews. Just say what problem faces your client and say you how you will help them solve it. Keep it simple.  
Your proposal is what gets your foot in the door. Read each job post carefully. When you send the proposal, talk about what problem they're having and suggest how they can solve it. Basically provide value and not sell yourself. Your aim is to get a response.
Honestly, Upwork is great for experience but I'd start looking elsewhere if you really want to dive into freelance work.
I use an RSS feed to keep up with websites on a daily basis, and I use Twitter and Instagram as a ‘fun’ way to consume whatever brain and eye candy is posted.
Just think of some honest questions, job interviews are a two way street you should make sure its the right company for you also.
Be really careful trying to use questions to 'wow' an interviewer, it has potential to backfire. 
Ask about ares that matter to you, what are the specific areas that interest you about SEO and ask how the role will involve these aspects.
Ask about career progression, training, what is the team like etc.
Its a very common question asked to SEO person that why you want to work in SEO 
3>Your before knowledge in digital marketing
If they don’t ask you to sign any conflict of interest document, you’re good. If they do, it’ll be up to you to decide if they extra money is worth not being able to work with other potential clients in the same industry. 
I’ve done the exact thing you’re doing and I’ve only had 1 situation like this, and it was for a Law Firm. So I understood the conflict of interest. Although it was only for a specific type of law, so it wasn’t a big deal for me.
Do what you want. There's no such thing as conflict of interest in digital marketing.
Just depends, honestly. I usually do $300/week for the whole campaign, $100 for each ad set. The Ads Manager has a pretty helpful Split Test option when setting up campaigns, maybe start there? But this is how I do it -
7. Let this run for a week to see if you have ample data to make a data driven decision. If not, let it run another week.
8. At the end of this you will have the best performing ad copy, matched with the best performing image so that you can increase the budget on a campaign that has the data to show this is the "best version".
9. You can do this with audience as well, and any other little detail you'd like to test.
Hope it helps!
I’ve worked with a couple kids who have digital marketing degrees. I’d rather hire a jr employee with an English degree or no degree at all because at least that kid won’t think he knows stuff.
I wouldn’t recommend it. I wish I hadn’t gotten a degree in this field because I’ve had to do continuing education. If you do then I would go for traditional marketing or something technology related.
I'm a digital marketer ( my degree is in Communication ) but I didn't receive any digital marketing training until after school. I found an entry level job at a Facebook marketing agency via Upwork. The training I got there was faster, cheaper, and way more comprehensive than I would've gotten in school. Plus I was working with tons of real clients every day.
I now run a marketing department for a multi-million dollar company but both my FB ads experience AND my degree got me in the door (plus a ton of hard work and self-teaching—Udemy has been a great resource). I wish I had spent more of my time in classes related to data and analytics. They are critical for any marketing role these days so I'd seriously recommend sharpening those skills! They'll take you far.
I did a comms degree (majoring in journalism) and that seems to benefit me more than a straight marketing degree. I did a bunch of marketing subjects, but I also know how to write - that’s a tougher skill to be able to glean from a job interview, but a journalism degree? They know I can write well.
Depends on the type of job you’re going for, but a whole marketing degree doesn’t sound flexible enough, and keep in mind that what you’re taught in a digital marketing subject WILL be slightly behind the times. When you finish your degree, the game will have changed. 
A marketing degree will teach you concepts. As a Kinesiology major in marketing, does it matter? I
Think you could get beyond that. One of my good friends in my company is one of the smartest people I know and had NO degree. It's the time and effort he's put in on the side and during the jobs he's landed.
Degrees can open the door, but aren't totally necessary. 
He had some concern with the 1099/Independent Contractor Agreement - he's primarily concerned with having to change his passwords and accounts if I were to leave (his last SEO guy did weird things with his websites and he said it was a nightmare to fix it after he left). Have you had clients express this concern to you? How did you come to an agreement? 
try to make it work on his favor. Make him believe he is in full control and that shouldnt be a problem
Hey, couldn´t help but reading about what you said on the 1099/Independent Contractor Agreement. I´m with an international digital media agency and we operate in Europe and South America and we´re looking into going back to the US (I was raised there actually), so I was wondering about what that contract considers in its contents. Would you mind sharing a few things (not the customer´s classified info, of course), but just the standard info?
Business intelligence and proper sales attribution/data management. It has a barrier to entry and every other type of marketing can benefit from it so I think this is a big one.
Then there are platforms that still will grow and improve: Reddit (?), Pinterest, Amazon paid to name a few
I would say 1:1 personal marketing is becoming more of a trend, but the tools to achieve this are still quite complex so not many digital marketers are skilled in this area.
I mean everyone knows content marketing but I feel it fits here

Feel free to msg me if you get stuck!
Send me your resume by PM. I work in Digital Marketing and could give you some pointers and possibly refer you to some recruiting agencies.
The no response is likely a no. Reddit ad department lags behind laws. They do not allow CBD links by reddit users and claim no CBD ads allowed. I am also not certain people come here to see or be reached by ads.   
OpenX is was pretty good but it has been a bit since I worked with them. I did traffic a lot of Draftking ads via them and never an issue even when Draftkings had legal issues.
Why not grow your organic traffic with search engine optimization in the meantime?
You already have major players in advertisement and options like reddit and linkedin really doesnt do much for you at this point
Does it work for long run?
Internal linking does help a bit, but not by much. You need to really build quality backlinks to you website to boost your rankings. On-page optimization can only get you so far.
PM me if you want to talk more about it
Is the company really worth all the effort? Does the job excite you? Are the benefits awesome? If the answer is no..maybe you should look elsewhere. I tend to avoid companies that ask a lot of me in the interview process unless I desperately want the job.
Yes because you don't have enough data as to budget and CVR
No because they might no nothing about digital marketing and you can educate them in that field. This can be lucrative for you.
Nonetheless, you gain nothing by not showing up. Put something cookie-cutter together, and be prepared to ask them a bunch of questions about what they currently do during the interview. If they say “this and that” doesn’t apply to our business, you explain that this top-level plan is just that. Adjustments are essential and you can only make those when you have sufficient data and knowledge of their business. 
They shouldn’t ask for that, but they did. Show up, do your best, and learn something.
Definitely go. My company always asks marketers to prepare a presentation like this with little to no information provided. They are likely not looking for you to nail the strategy, but more likely looking for how you react under stress and how you approach the situation. Good luck!
Thanks for all the advice, everyone.
Having looked at the company’s current materials, it’s my lack of graphic design skills that are concerning me now.
* VP - Strategy, ROI, 3 and 5 year vision
Marketing is often fake it until you make it... the ground shifts and correlation of campaigns is difficult. We are the ultimate, failure is an orphan, success has many fathers field. 
If you trust the company, do the work and get the reps.
If I really wanted the job I would talk through three slides about what parts of digital marketing go where in the funnel then recommend that we do all of it well.
I’ve been looking to move to a different company for years but also suffer from depression and anxiety. I’ve previously attended interviews but, having been rejected, my mood would become so low that I’d stop applying for several months.
In December, my wife and I had our second child and I started making a concerted effort to move on. I’ve been to 20+ interviews since and haven’t received a single offer.
Contact Support via your Ads Manager. They much more likely to help people that spend money on their platform, sadly. They're almost always helpful, and if they can't be they will get someone to email that will be able to help.
I worked out a way to do a complete name change. Rather not post it publicly so PM me and I'll tell you what I did.
I don’t know for sure, but I think when you have more than 2000 fans (or something) you actually need to contact the Facebook support.
1. If he has Digital Graphics experience, let him do some test runs for creatives.
5) Clickfunnels is garbage, though the client will refer to them frequently during all negotiations
10) Do the right thing and don't be evil (but define "evil" as loosely as Google does)
Enlighten me about Clickfunnels
**4. Be patient:** The success of social networks and digital marketing, content do not happen overnight. Although it is possible to catch a lightning bolt in a bottle, it is likely that you will need to commit long term to achieve results. The secret lies in finding the appropriate language for your audience. 
You're right about follower count, it's not the best metric... a bit more of a vanity metric in my opinion but at least it indicates that your reach is growing.   
Hope that helps!
Tread carefully though, if you are employed full time you might struggle dealing with your own clients. What happens when a client wants to discuss something while you're at work or you need to edit a campaign? I can't see your current employer letting you freelance on the side.
Networking. Reaching out. Offering services.
Then there is also, fiverr, upwork.
You can use google my business app to find local business as well.
Moreover, carry a personality that people trust. More often than not, people want a digital marketing consultant. Lots of business owners will automatically want to connect with you and if you impress them enough, you might be hired. 
Also make sure your contract doesn't include a non-competitor clause/find out if your work culture prohibits that kind of thing. Last thing you want is to lose your job while trying to brand out.
Make whoever you're talking to feel like they would be really fucking up if they didn't pass the info on to someone higher up.
Talk about what others are doing or even their competitors if you can do the research. Go to them with facts, not speculation.
If possible make presentations with after effects and leave the link with your business card.
Trim the data to the essentials: lead generation, SEO, CPC, CRO etc. 
I’d also love really like to know the answers to these questions :)
I started in sales to get into the industry.
I majored in something different but it’s worked out for me. 
The company I work for doesn’t care at all about education as long as you have the skills and some work history. 
You may have to work for free for a bit before you break in. I did, anyway.
Honestly, you could pay a regular WordPress developer for this if you don't want to do it yourself. I'm a developer, who dabbles in marketing and this isn't a super difficult task in most cases, but a bit time consuming. 
The cheapest and fastest thing you could do is install a caching plugin like W3 Total Cache. Check out a tutorial for setting it up (I'm new here so I probably can't post links). W3TC can cache pages and database results. In most cases, that will solve your problems. 
you can pay me :) ill even automate the process for you so that you can set and forget
You need Seo and SEM.
I help agencies/businesses who want to outsource their link building, here are my tips on how to build backlinks:  
What other questions about SEO /link building did you have?
If you have a limited budget, then you should start building backlinks on high-authority sites. What do I mean by that? Profile links, web 2.0's, social bookmarks, article submissions, etc.
The basic backlinks are your local business directories, but these have its limits.
Another way to do it is to ask for a guest post on a popular blog with high DA. But they will most likely say to cough up expensive money.
So the best way is to actually buy links of high TF 15-25+. But I would avoid fiverr and all these marketplaces because they really do not work
PM me and I can provide you with these if you wish
Hope that helps!
So funnel is: Facebook ads > Landing page > Weekly emails > Purchasing page. And there are videos at every step.
Does that help?
Priests demand more wisdom of light.
I don't mean to be a "heretic" but I think one of the biggest things lost is "what is acceptable content" & "real SEO."  You could ask one SEO'er and they will scream to the gods: it is "long form content with 3K plus words on a page", another may say "Q & A style!". The fact is many posts are all about what "Google wants you to do".  But then there is the reality of what you should really be doing.
You have the "purists" that follow the holy grail of the "google bible", then you have the "sinners", the ones figuring out the real truth behind the church.  In the end, the balance needs to be found between the two, because to be honest, going full religious fanatic will actually yield you very little results.
How big revenue wise? What are their long term plans? Brick and mortar? Loyalty programs? Anything unique they want to do with their customer experience? Do they offer subscriptions to their product? Will they want a mobile app or simply mobile responsive? What back end financial systems are they operating on?
Bug commerce
Others may differ, but in the UK I've found more success for me and my clients not with lead ads but creating an ad that directs to a landing page to capture lead information.  
When I've done A/B tests on this much higher conversion rates and lower CPL guiding to a landing page.  
In terms of asking for examples and the copy and the image, make it unique to YOU. Make it related to the pain points and struggles of your target audience and GIVE them something in exchange for their email. Don't expect loads of leads flooding in without giving them anything in return.  
But even more than that Facebook will have 'tagged you as 'relevant' for those sort of ads. So you can keep seeing the good, the bad and the fucking terrible on your feed.
It all depends on industry and buyer's persona. 
Do a/b testing. Keep doing what is working and keep tweaking what is not performing well.
As for design, you have to base this once again on the audience you want to show the ad to.  Do the psychological research on these interest groups and find out what that interest group is willing to click on.  Example: Interests groups related to coupons react really well to big buttons on the ad with price off or discount percentage with words like "limited time", "only while supplies last" with the product image in the background.  Hiring good designers is key to create engaging ads.
Since you have no budget, cold email or cold calling is the only way to go.
SEO / PPC.... if people are researching the topics you are writing about then seems like that should work for inbound demand (assuming there is demand)
Best way is to just scrape it off the net but it is time consuming to sift and compile the data.
Cold emailing is a problem also because of so may restrictions that need to be followed for high deliverability.
Creating a FB agency is easy. As you possibly noticed, it is the client acquisition that is the hardest to do. If you are serious about this, then PM me
I’ve been drinking, but no.
Yes easy to tweak for cheap CPMs but who cares if those aren’t converting 😌😌😌 it’s about creative, ROAS, scale, car, etc so again, drinking but no
Just showing CPM is REALLY fishy. Generally, to reach more apt customers you have to spend more. My guess is they're blasting their ads worldwide with little to no regard for who's seeing it, which drives the CPM down, but will definitely also lead to terrible other KPIs.
Super opaque and red flags shooting up for me. Proceed with caution, or better, don’t proceed.
Yeah umm, no. 
Zapier. It's a fucking life saver.
You’re not referring to a “media buyer” are you?
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:
- [/r/ppc] [Google trends keyword research match types?](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/bkbbec/google_trends_keyword_research_match_types/)
Doesn’t mean less spending on google ads, just mean people are moving away from text ads and moving toward dynamic and responsive.
ppc will never be gone until Google is gone. 70% of their revenue comes from Google ads.
 \* Voice Search also trends in Digital Marketing
The growth has been rapid and exponential. It's obvious why.  If the founder said he was going to take on the Gaints, who would have not made fun of him.
If you want local traffic, start with Googles local business and Yelp, both are free.   Most people use their mobile phones when they're out and about looking for liquor, your store will show up on google if they're in the area.
Social Media will not help you.  liquor stores are everywhere and all the same.  People are not loyal to one store, they'll go where its closes. So 99% of your business will be from locals.
If you want to pay, you could make a facebook page and target your local audience.
Social media ads will work and so will email marketing. 
Utilize social media to post organically and gain a following. 
Digital marketing works and if you’re not doing it, you’re losing. 
I don't know where you live, but if they allow alcohol delivery, I would DEFINITELY do it. I'm in South Florida and you can get alcohol delivered on on one of the "food" delivery apps. Can't remember which one, BUT....keeping your product at a good price and not jack up your delivery fee would increase your awareness and loyalty.
The free listings like GMB and yelp take ages to build momentum and possibly never, if you do not optimize it with contents all the time. The problem with Google 3 snack pack is that your actual website needs to be seriously SEO optimized to show up in the top for major keywords.
PM me if you want to discuss more about it.
Don’t get me wrong I neglect my own SM presence because I do it for work, but I do still have all of them so I can better understand what’s going on from a user perspective.
Nah bro unless you’re an influencer
Most are saying No but let me be devil's advocate. I do look at social media presence but not how you think. I see it as extended learning. Show me you leverage tools like social to study the competiton/industry, understand trends, best practices, breaking news, rumor reports, etc
See,Its not compulsion that you have to make social media presence to get job in digital marketing,as in digital marketing there are many channels like SEO,PPC,Email marketing,SMM ,you have to decide first in which channel you want to be expert. but yes it will increase you experience to work in digital marketing,as digital marketer should be updated in all such sites which gives new trends every day to work in this industry.
Nope not at all. I use social media for work but not really personally. They don’t care about that. You can learn trends at any time
I must say you should have an understanding of the social media and how it's works. trust me it's not tough. keep an eye on each social media channel and understand how marketing works there. Good luck
For example, I need my advertisers to be smart and witty, not only knowing tools and understanding data. They have to work with graphic design teams, write copy for ads tailored to specific channel. So I looked around their social media accounts a little bit before making a decision. 
You need at least 5K followers on each platform to get remotely close to landing a job in DM. Good luck my friend.
Hope that helps!
Hope this helps!
Ultimately it depends on what the objectives for each social media you want to achieve. Both strategies make sense but you need to allocate the right amount of resources and to state feasable aims to your social media marketing strategy. Hit me up if you have any questions :)
But it does depend on what the brands end goal is too.
Print and digital work even better when paired together
You can slay in certain verticals with direct mail (high margin stuff with long turn around)
Okay let me be more specific LOLOL
What are the best ways to grow your followers, engagement ,and retention rate on a Instagram page?What are some other automation softwares that are actually legit that you would recommend? My goal is to be able to bring a thousand followers minimum to an account that deals with photography(nature). Give any targeting and retargeting methods that can help me in any way.Any type of Facebook ad campaign I should be running to get more followers? People say traffic ad campaigns work but I had no luck. I'm trying to grow my skills in Instagram Marketing
2. Run contest while posting, like, 
engagement vs Time relation.
You need to do search engine optimization for your website. Sure doing some minor changes like that definitely helps than not doing it, but it is going to take serious effort and time to rank it up there for a valuable keyword.
There are not many adult friendly SEO as well. Most probably will not even touch it.
PM me if you want to discuss
In my company, we had a similar situation. Despite the fact that we are a digital marketing company, we have applied a person who had nothing to do with marketing and was working in the film industry before. But this fact helped her to develop a really brave campaign for our platforms. Now it works perfectly.  
Also spending budget efficienctly is a good point.  The reason people do DM is to cut down budget.  Remind the company that it's easier to spend money wisely and try out multiple campaigns in the same budget and not reduce it.  
They say it's usually 2-5% depending on engagement so that would be 200-500.
Its very much pay to play nowadays. They want you to run paid ads.
There's no way unless your post goes extremely viral
Facebook Ads Manager. You've gotta pay to play these days!
Apologies if this all sounds obvious, but this is how I would approach it. 1. Step back into what purpose the site *is* supposed to be serving, not everything is transactional. 2. Consider who is likely to benefit and seek to know more about that. 3. What questions will they have that the site can answer or connect to. Then the usual google trends, search console and competitor analysis.
I did a sure for a large insurance company that doesn't want direct traffic because they seem through local agents, but then I showed them how we can direct traffic to their local agent network and they were floored.
4. Use your money and put it towards fb/ ig ads. 
6. Experiment a lot and test on what marketing campaigns are worth it
On top of my head, Schedule Webinars. They work like magic in education sector.
Also, get the website optimized. One of the Reasons why it's failing is this. Will you trust an education course of 850£ with shitty website? 
Sell them some on site-optimization, and explain to them why it's badly needed.
Sounds like a project you shouldn’t have bother taking and possibly didn’t qualify enough for yourself.
I’d walk away tbh. 
Bottom line - cut your losses and walk away. 
If they have a crap site and no traffic, you’re spinning wheels.
The money is not worth the headache, your time, your extra effort, your personal name and reputation.
They clearly don’t get you, the communication isn’t on the same page, and they’re pulling you all over the place. 
Just my opinion.
I wouldn’t have even agreed to this job and would’ve qualified further before hand. 
Maybe targeting is off? Get more specific in the demographic, age range, location etc... 
Run it against the current ads and see if traffic increases. 
You may already be doing this, but you could request a review during the discharge process. Perhaps a flyer, or a line on the discharge paperwork (disclaimer: I don’t know the legality of this but it would avoid the opt-in issue vis a vis texts and email).
We had this come up recently. Client runs a local business improvement district. 
Normally, we always say no to this kind of request. 
However, this client has been working with our company for 10+ years and referred many qualified leads over that time, so we said yes. They pay a monthly retainer for ~4 hours of my time. After a basic training session or two, I audit their campaigns before they go live and offer suggestions. 
This client has always been great to work with, and it has been a great arrangement so far. They insist they are a 3/10 on the tech savvy scale but are in fact 7/10. I could see this arrangement being an absolute nightmare in many other situations. 
Hope that helps!
Ask to be paid by the hour. Why not? If not you then they'll pay someone else to teach them.
I do a variation of this with certain clients. I work with several law firms, and some of the solo or small firms have more time than budget available. I charge for account setup and include a list of weekly and monthly tasks. I also offer 2 hours per month to check on the account and provide suggestions or make changes in the account. This works for the firm, as the save money while generating leads and I gain their trust while displaying my expertise. Then when the client gets too busy and gets solid ROI they have me take over the account. This is good for both pof us. They can dip their toes in, learn and understand the strategy of Google Ads and end up being a more informed and better client to work with. Both sides win. 
But I also filter out clients that I feel I won't get along with, so I don't work with everyone who wants to do this type of arrangement.
* CPC - high traffic
This is how they scam you:
* CPM - low quality cheap impressions
* CPC - cheap bot traffic
* CPA - don't allow retargeting pixels from agencies, or check if traffic sent by agencies are actually returning visitors (this means that they're retargeting your traffic, and it's more common that you might think). Also check if agencies are using "post-view" conversion tracking to charge you and don't do this (it's BS). Due to cookie blocking, using multiple devices and other attribution problems, CPAs are hardest to pull successfully, and if they work surprisingly well, then the odds are you're being gamed...
It depends on the goal of the campaign. If you just want branding/awareness, CPM is fine. If the goal is lead generation,  CPM makes no sense to focus on.
On the platforms that matter, Display = CPM. That's basically it.
CPM can get you more scale
Generally this is less the agency’s choice than the publishers. For example display/banner platforms are usually built around CPM’s. Search platforms are generally CPC. Social runs the gamut. Affiliate does CPA. Though note most platforms have flexibility in pricing models these days. 
CPM is the way the inventory is purchased from the publisher so whether you are being charged a marked up CPM or a CPC it's all the same.
Since clicks are largely irrelevant to a display campaign even for ROAS/Retargeting you'll still want to pay for impressions. Clicks on the ads versus actual traffic registered by analytics is always going to be much lower. 
For programmatic display we charge a Max $6 CPM for example on $3000+ budgets but we often deliver much lower at say $1.5 to 4 CPM combined prospecting and retargeting. 
Low CPM like low CPC means you won't be able to bid on your most valuable users which is less relevant on prospecting (minus garbage inventory) but very important on retargeting.
Yeah social isn’t about selling immediately, all about nurturing sales and event triggering when the time is right.
Certification doesn't work in DM. Agencies judge someone of work experience. Hence - quicker and better way for you to learn and grow will be to take a project and let it grow under your tutelage. Contact any small shop owner or business and request them to allow you to do DM for them at small cost or free of cost.
Hit me up!
There is one and only best solution for you. 
I have looked into all webinar solutions and they are all rip offs except Demio
I say stop with the BS webinar 2 hour pitch.
I have a very detailed campaign for targeting home buyers. We aren't in the same market, shoot me a dm and I will send you over what is working for me.
Be careful how you target. I ran marketing for two real estate brokerages. Using zip codes is good but FB would often be pesky about targeting certan areas. 
Exclude people with the job title "Real estate broker or agent" if you don't want someone else to spam your ads comment section. Many older people tend to give their numbers on the comment itself, so actively monitor it and after noting it down delete it asap.  Not exactly  the tip you were asking for, but it will help you in any real estate related ads.
If they won't give you access to the Google Ads account and all you want to do is review their keyword selection, get the client to export a list of their keywords including match types and any other metrics you need.
Go to Google Ads > Ads & extensions > Remove all columns so there is no data > Download.
The best you can do in that situation is use a tool like SEMrush to see what keywords their ads show for check their ads/landing pages.
They clearly have no idea how google ads works.
I am exactly the same. I hate not being able to see the full picture of the company. Anytime this happens I always have to go back and google to go to the main page. Annoys the living shit out of me.
I actually believe that less options means less time to think. But there are tons of ways to apply this idea to a website. So boldly suggesting "removing menu buttons" might not work for most of the web sites. 
I suggest you to track your page views with tools like hot jar, and modify places where they leave.
Yes. You are. If you are looking for pricing, while the consultation is free, it means the landing page is not done well. The visitor is suppose to feel that they have nothing to lose taking up the free consultation while the consultation would be able to solve their problem.
That being said, several users are doing it over insta and i have suscribed to them.
Step 1 - Your spotify list must be really unique and appeal to a certain demographic (if you don't do this no marketing gimmicks will help you gain traction)
Step 2 - I would approach a designer/illustrator to generate a logo to accompany your playlist and social media content so as to make your brand identifiable and stand out
Perpetual traffic by Digital marketer, particularly episodes with Ezra and Molly. Then just trial and error.
Experiment and learn from experience. That's the only way to learn. 
In addition to what everyone's mentioned, try not to make your audiences too granular. Lump like audiences together so FB's algorithm has more data to work off of.
Strategies vary based on the end result you’re shooting for.
Thanks for the tip. There are lots of misinformation out there on content curation. I wanted to adopt it as a content marketing strategy since it's difficult to write but read somewhere that it hurts SEO.  Will have to look into what you said.
Don't spend your money yet. It's not there. At least online. Your products are the same as everyone else's, from what I could find on your website. But that's totally fine. Looks like you're trying to create a lifestyle brand, not a product line. $800 isn't enough to do that, though. You need some organic work.
Work with people on Instagram, give them product and have them post about it. Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc. All the same. Find people who have the audience that you want to target and work with them. 
Your website also needs a lot of work to make this happen. Took some digging to find your purpose. And there's not a ton of text on the homepage. There are some broken links, no blog/community that I could see, and not a ton in the way of people promoting your lifestyle in your brand. This might be another area to spend some coin - get a photographer to do a lifestyle shoot for you. 
I do these things for startups all the time. Let me know if you need help with anything.
Your return on ad spend should dictate that. If you are profitable and losing impression share to budget, yes increase the budget.
If you have experience/samples from previous work that would apply to this company, reference that and try to steer clear of laying out all your great ideas before they make a hiring decision.
Show them what having YOU on the team could mean for their overall growth strategy, not just your ideas.
By X amount of prospects, do you mean leads? It really depends what area of digital marketing you're focusing on.
 What I would also make sure is that everything is tight knit and ignore volume. Reason I say this is because 1. Google keyword planner is not 100% accurate when it comes to volume statistics and 2. Because it's better to have low volume and a high amount of conversions than high volume and a low amount of conversions. Why? Because having lots of volume but low conversions is literally flushing money down the drain. And conversions = money... And that's the end goal here. I would build up my ad groups, keywords and negative keyword list. Then I would create three ads per ad group for a/b split testing. I would also tack on two ad extensions for all ads, which the most common ones are call extensions and locations extensions. Those two get the most clicks. Then I would check the site to see if it's optimized for mobile as well as the sites loading times. Mobile is especially important because 60% of people today now surf the web with their smartphones according to mozcon. Then I would finally create a retargeting campaign because 95% of people who go onto your page leave within the next 5 seconds, but when your ad tracks then, your conversions rise.
Depending how how advanced they are even simple things like that could blow their mind.
Printed media 
Online media
2. look for interesting media, look for successful newspapers, look for awful bad conspiracy shit (you need to know how bad job looks like)
5. after that - you need to know if it is worth it, yeah? So analyze it, yeah? How much visitor you have on your blog - so google academy, google analytics... SEO basics.
Dont do broad tutorials like: "Digital Marketing, master everything and be mega hero". No good. It is all about curiosity. 
Reddit has helped me a lot and has a ton of info about career paths, but if you need some resources, PM me and I will link you some :p
Have you tried digital audio channels? I know from experience that promoters like Live Nation are heavy users of digital audio advertising on streaming apps to sell tickets. I work in the digital audio space, so feel free to DM if you want more info. Thanks!
Emailing has not worked for you yet possibly because it was not enticing to them.
Please remember cold emails are only a way to get yourself noticed, sales and closing are done through subsequent contacts and emails. But in the end, no matter how personalized your emails are, it is all about the numbers.
We send 500-1000 personalized cold emails per day and close clients every other day through phone calls.
I can help you with this if you wish. Just let me know.
I’ve been doing it for 10 years without any certifications. I think proven results are what counts. I don’t think it’s affected my career. 
With or without certificates, your way into the field is to take a shitty entry level gig to get experience and get out ASAP.
I’ve worked in Digital Marketing for 3 years . Just got promoted to Marketing Communications Manager.. 
I primarily do the following: 
- maintain social media channels / build social strategy
-oversee and manage brochure and print materials
- develop our marketing strategy along the different channels we utilize to reach our audience 
I do track my data and I am implementing automation to ... all things you can learn on the job...
Learn the platforms. Don't rely on getting the "good stuff" from any of these online course. Do the research. Watch the trends. FREELANCE. Take internships. Create some free campaigns for family, friends, family friends, whomever, to learn what areas or industries you enjoy the most. The best thing you can learn from is failure in digital marketing. It is not easy in the field, and this is not to deter you. It's the honest (and sometimes crushing) truth. So when you get shut down over and over, or have unhappy clients, just remember, this is apart of the process and don't give up.
**Valuable Assets to have in D.M.:**
2. Being able to read the data and make data driven decisions using Google Analytics 
5. Premiere editing skills. Even if they are mid-tier. Being able to film and/or take prerecorded video, and make a little 30-45 second video clips for your campaigns is so valuable. Video ads are really starting to gain traction, so it's nice to be able to *spice* things up when refreshing your ads.
6. SEO, I guess. But that's gonna be a no from me, fam. Just not my thing. 
People want a "jack of all trades" these days in D.M.. Because if not, you have literally hire 6 vendors, and NO ONE likes having that many (overpriced) vendors. Good luck, bud. We'll see you out there. **And stop spending all that money on shitty online courses.**
I've been doing digital marketing for some time now. Only once I've been asked about a certificate (i think it was that Facebook blueprint someone was mentioning). And this one time I was applying for the career in one big agency. Clients care only about the experience and how can you make them some moneeeyyy! :D
You can start your own agency without college experience. So just proof of knowledge.
Certificates can help you land a job in the industry. Results will make you grow and stay in the industry
Honestly, none
Learn to sell. Cars, real estate, vacuum cleaners, digital ad campaigns... doesn’t matter. Actual practical experience getting verbally abused by customers who either don’t want it, or only want it if they can have it yesterday for half the price and in a different color will teach you more about how to advertise than 1000 hours watching udemy videos.
Dont do it. They are phishing for free advice. Give them enough information to prove you know what to do but dont tell them specifically. They likely are doing this to dozens of "prospects" with no intention to hire them. I have been through this before, essentially providing thousands of dollars worth of information for nothing. Offer to do an evaluation and create a marketing plan as a consultant but dont do it for free.
Google digital garage then just learn by doing!
Google Ad Words certificate is free and a good introduction to concepts
2. Why would you run ads for a company, that is attached to your personal or business account? Each company HAS to have its own business page so that you can run ads through these pages. Ads are shown with the business attached. It would make no sense to promote a product, with the ad being shown through your facebook page.
3. I would do A LOT more testing and research before you sign any clients that you are going to be running ads for. If you are not an expert, or very informed, you will have unhappy clients. Unhappy clients lead to bad reviews. Bad reviews lead to no business. No business leads to you working a shitty job that you hate.
4. Add the client Ad Accounts for the aforementioned pages to business manager. This is the same as above. If you already have access to it, you can just add it right in. If not, you can request access to the ad account using the ad account ID. Client will need to approve these kinds of requests.
5. If the client doesn't have an ad account yet, walk them through setting one up, then request access to it. You will only have a certain number of ad accounts you can create from within business manager on behalf of clients, so its good to have them do this themselves so you don't max out.
7. IMPORTANT: Set up auto-delivered reports of campaign stats to be delivered to you at regular intervals. If a client pulls the plug (only real downside of organizing everything this way is that the client usually still has full control and authority over everything) you will lose access to historical data - no good if you're trying to prove the value of the service you're providing and need to reference stats.
With business manager you can work in one single user interface, and manage all of your various assets - Facebook pages, ad accounts, audience insights, audience builders, payment methods, etc. That's what it was built for. You can also grant access to employees (and revoke it if need be) and provided different levels of access for different people. There's no reason not to use it. Like I said, it was built for that.
When you set up a campaign the first few times you are going to have a make a bunch of decisions you really didn’t think about before and might not understand. 
Not to hijack this thread but any advice on how to run A/B tests on FB?
Before I created my A/B tests on Facebook, I used Optimizely's sample size calculator and found I needed a sample size of 70,000 per variation to reach 95% statistical significance. While I was setting up my campaigns, Facebook said the potential reach will be 430,000 so I thought I was safe.
What am I doing wrong & how could I avoid this next time? Thanks in advance for your help.
If it’s anything political and the company is not registered as a political organization, you’re going to have a tough time getting an ad approved as Facebook has understandably cracked down on political themed ads. 
If you HAVE registered as a political organization or you are not petitioning for anything political, then in my opinion I’d run a lead form as where it’s very, very easy to collect information. Depending on demo you might want to check out Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. 
If they’re four different variations, you probably would not want to carry over the engagement as that would skew the results and make it challenging to identify which variation works best.
Well, for starters, why was the app deleted? They wouldn’t have done it by accident. 
If you resubmit it without understanding why it was deleted, it will just get suspended again. And after 3 suspensions, you’re banned for life.
Check your emails. This happened to us recently and it was because of a Google policy change that we needed to comply with in our app. We got sent an email about it prior to the app being pulled, but it was in an inbox that nobody checks.
Yes, but mainly because you are a small fish in a very competitive pond.  Trying to compete in Google Adwords for an SEO/Link Building business seems like it would be damn near impossible to compete with some of the bigger boys in that space.
From a more broad perspective, I see SEM becoming more of a commodity.  It seems it is more of a defensive play to avoid being conquested, as opposed to 10 year ago it was offensive.  
When I got into the business 10+ years ago I saw vendors charging ridiculous fee structures for Google Ad campaigns...  In some instances upwards of 40% of media.  Now it seems like a price war to the bottom, with 10-15% fees.  SEM is becoming a commodity.
Think of the intent of the searcher. What OTHER things do people search for that could lead them to wanting a link building service?
Think long tail keywords to content and make the sale on the retargeting.
Yes, it is because there are millions of online marketing services provider who are using Google ads. That's why there is a high competition to compete with the other service providers. The competition is higher than ever before because of some of the industry leaders, not just competitive with the massive amount of money but they also get the high adscore every time they put their ad on Google ads.
>CPC isn't cheap, but the ROI can be worth it. For example, over the past week for my account we have spent over 30k but with a ROI of 692%...  It's not easy, but it can be done.   
One question for you though, have you gone through the demo process with a Sharp Spring rep? I did that earlier this year and it answered a lot of my questions.
At this point, it's just a little more than I need for my small business clients.
Moz has updated its database.. don't worry to much
There is the only reason that MOZ has updated their algorithm to calculate the domain authority.
No. And dead links hurt SEO, so always add redirects for 404s.
I am not sure why digital marketers need to know html and css since there is WordPress and/or other alternatives.
That said, i wouldn't bother with web development since 35% of the internet \[websites\] runs on WordPress.
Its like Centres in the NBA... typically you dont need to and are not expected to shoot 3 pointers....but what if you can?
This question is too vague to really answer. OP define what you mean by “digital marketing”
If digital marketing to you means strategy (planning) and the “doing” of things (seo strat and execution, building emails, building sites, building display ad units) then yes - you’ll need various levels of coding. 
That’s why you’re seeing conflicting answers to your question.
Edit: cleaned up my formatting a bit.
Pretty much anyone in Digital Marketing needs to know basic HTML/CSS, no way around that. Javascript is a nice to have but you can copy+paste most stuff once you know a bit about it.
You do not need to know ANY coding. 
It might be beneficial at times, but it’s not a barrier anymore. 
With software like Wordpress anyone can launch a website in minutes without touching a line of code. 
Is it mandatory? No--but put yourself in the client's shoes. Who are you more likely to sign a large contract with? The digital agency that also understands the foundation of the web, how websites are coded, and how to extract actionable metrics from how people interact with your website for your digital ad campaigns? 
These are the people that I constantly win business from because their sites fall apart, look like shit, are too slow, get broken, are poorly designed, not responsive, not customer-focused and ultimately cost them more in the long run.
Knowing how to setup GTM, and to get proper nuanced data from campaigns from a fast landing page is paramount in digital marketing. Knowing the underlying code for these things will make you a better digital marketer. Period.
There is no need to learn too deep coding for the digital marketers. But they should have the basic knowledge of CSS and HTML.  On the other hand, if they have the JS knowledge then it will also be a plus point for them.
Since it is a bot - it's not that it's targeting especially you - it just follows his algorithm of targeting accounts, and you maybe pop up because of one of the reasons mentioned above.
A client did that and it did generate traffic but conversions were abysmal due to a non functioning website accompanied by limited content.
If all those twitter clicks bounced/had very short time on page they may not have been counted by GA.
Honestly if you can't make remarketing profitable with it don't waste your time.
Of which social is: 13   
Also, some clicks sourced from social media platforms like TW and FB get counted under Referrals and Direct in GA.  
Do you want to work agency side, or in house? Agency would be an obvious choice given you have direct client experience, but in house pays more and be less hectic in terms of work hours.
In-house agency corporate marketer here. I moved into this role after freelancing for a few months and am really glad I did. I still am able to flex my schedule as needed but also have a ton of stability (plus great benefits). One thing I was really focused on was a 401k plan, so I'm sticking corporate for now.
It's definitely possible. I went from freelance to in-house to agency and now back to freelance. There are pros and cons to all of them but I'm glad to be back freelance as I don't like to have too much income coming from one source. There is strength in numbers! :)
I’m about a month into my digital marketing and web design agency. What is the best way to to get clients. What methods have worked for you guys in the past and what is the best way to approach it?
Google Tag Manger is the "easiest" solution but you need to be mindful that you might get false positives if you don't get the trigger right. 
I was told by one of my professors at uni that you don't want to buy a book on social media marketing because it changes so fast. There are plenty of resources on YouTube and academies that can teach you the basics then you just run with it and see what works for you and what doesn't.
I recommend searching display ads for the particular social media site that you want to learn. Or even just "basic social media marketing help" into YouTube. 
Find a mentor..i.e. someone making a good living doimg what you want to do.
Love this idea!
I have only 39 karma here so not to strong account I have yet. Give me advise about how we do this.
I am happy to help.
Hey! Guess what! I have made a subreddit moviemarketing. We choose a movie and watch its marketing stuffs. The channels how they communicate and everything we want.  There we can talk about everything without disturbing the others.
How long have you been doing traditional marketing? Personally I would take a role in a smallish company where they needed someone to do everything, i.e. the real world activity as well as building online presence. Ideally in a company where they were not good online so you could quickly be the expert and make a measurable impact. Do lots of reading/learning, spend their budget trying things out and in a year or two look for a dedicated DM role
Your base knowledge of tips and tricks (urgency, scarcity, away pain, towards pleasure) still very much apply! 
What industry have you marketed in the past?
That's a very broad question with not too much context. Marketing Strategy has multiple layers, look up the "P's of marketing" for one. You should find some entry level marketing strategy concepts from there.
Most of my business revenue comes from my specialty SEO, and web design because that is my specialty. I only do strategy consulting if I know it's within my expertise.
Experience is the only real teacher. Jump into it. 
Hello! I teach social media if you'd like to email me - laura@thatbritishchick.com
I'd reccomend you to start with google certificate exams. There is great content for you to study and the exams are free to do! Not only you get certified officially by Google, but you can learn all you need to know at a decent level in Google Analytics and Google Ads. Facebook has a similar program/exam for advertising in the platform (Facebook & Instagram)
I think the facbook groups is the only organic way. If u think in business page it will cost a lot for you.
I don’t have construction background but from what I see is that you may want to consider better highlighting the benefits the receiver can get from engaging with you (perhaps in clear bulletpoints). Another thing that would be interesting to revisit is your subject line. I am also wondering whether LinkedIn Inmail would not be more effective (not familiar with your industry so not sure!)? Hope this helps!
The construction industry is currently extremely busy, so most good contractors aren’t going to have the time for a call that might help them. From the start show them how you will help them get work and save them time in the process. The main thing I would focus on is how you will save them time with your services. I work as a construction manager and I can tell you these contractors are not bidding projects simply because they don’t have the time to with how much work there is.
I like to have my first paragraph as my UVP.  Helps tremendously with cold email response. 
Our app decreases soldier mortality rates by 20% by increasing white walker confusion.
So my first go to is to broadly bait them so they cannot refuse and get on the call to discuss more in detail later.
Let me know if you need help.
Google doesnt sell your search history + phone number lmao, that's a massive GDPR / privacy breach.
Can you imagine? Someone googles the word "mortgage" BOOM! 850 calls, and they dont stop ever.
Check your phone / computer for spyware. This is highly unusual
You need to target people whose job title is Chef, not interest. If the audience size is too small, try to target interests that only professional chefs would have. This might need a little research on your end.
Although you might miss some. 
3.1 mil people are not a very big audience and you will not spend too much money on showing to them. But if you make sure your offer clearly only matches Chefs, for example: yearly Chef summit, or something. You should not worry too much about the targeting, Facebook will do it for you eventually.
Personally, I don’t think anyone is still using the term SMO anymore?
I have used SurveySwap. In fact you fill in other surveys for credits, and you pay credits to the people who filled your survey. You can also pay for credits if you’re lazy tho. You can even target certain demographics (age, country etc). I had around 300 respondents in 2 weeks. Hope this helps! :)
You need to test your budgets to find a middle ground and get more traffic
How much is your daily ad spend vs your audience size?
Yeah don't do that.  
Always a bad idea quitting before you find more work, barring unhealthy circumstances. 
How old is the leadership? Sound like they begrudgingly throw money at content marketing because people told them they had to. If they are looking to hire an unpaid intern to supplement your role, they don't value what you do. So what **does** the company value? Generally, revenue, sales, transaction and customer lifetime. Those are stats a leader understands. Start tracking and reporting your successes in how they affect the earnings of the company, how your efforts create user growth that can be tracked to transactions, and how much loyal users can be expected to add to revenue over the next few years with the proper nourishing through your media role. Make it simple and truthful.
Also, working with strategy and helping drive the direction of the company using Analytics could be a boost for you, and you may want to try to take some of that responsibility from the agency. My last gig I earned my stripes by stepping in and calling bullshit on several reporting errors the agency sent us. They weren't lazy but they were completely wrong on several important reports that were driving our decision making. Managers and owners hate looking at  reports that they don't understand, and as an intermediary I became essential (until leaders stopped listening to managers and went belly-up).
My instincts tell me that they won't promote you since they are actively looking for new unpaid interns.
I got my first job at an agency with zero ppc experience through sheer persistence (3 interviews and 2 tests). Just apply and don't take no for an answer.
Not Succeeding is not Failure..True Failure is when close yourself down too early in trying things and work hard..
If you really wanna leave it...Leave it after achieving it.
It’s always better to find a new role whilst you are in a job. Wanting to leave to better yourself is more marketable to new employers.
You know what, forget the old way of thinking "don't quit until you have a job". I have quit several times before having a job, and put 100% of my energy into finding a better fit. As long as you have the savings to do so, and the drive to actually make sh\*t happen (in your case, sounds like that is advancing your education), I would advise you to take that leap!
You do need to have a gmb set up and running ofc.
Have you left a review in the past? Google will use that previous experience to get you to leave more reviews. It will also take into account the amount of time spent at a location to then determine whether you stayed there long enough to actually use the business.
Google does that automatically, I seems to happen more for a reviewer with a lot of reviews marked as helpful. I wish there was a way to reach out to "helpful" reviewers and invite to the location, but I don't think Google shares that data. Someone smart might be able to scrape that info from r/LocalGuides. "Please review us on Google" signage could get the ball rolling, raffles for review, etc...
Just be able to prove wins for customers.. best part of digital marketing... Results should be the only thing that matters...
No matter what you decide to showcase- make sure you are comfortable speaking about it! It should be yours! We had candidates that brought a booming portfolio, but with no knowledge to back it up - it doesn't hold for long in the interview.
In just the U.S., businesses spend around $100 billion a year on digital marketing with that number growing every year. 
So many people need to learn what digital marketing is lol. Also yes I work as a PPC specialist remotely.
Digital marketing is really just regular marketing except on a computer instead of paper. Can you make a living doing marketing? Yep. So you can make a living doing digital marketing. It's the same thing. In quite a few instances (my own experience included), I do exactly what I would do in a traditional marketing position, I just also happen to work with data from websites and search engines. But I also deal with the analytics side, creating content and campaigns, branding, advertising, determining the effectiveness of past campaigns and how they could be better, optimizing pages, allocating budgets to various marketing initiatives, and calculating the ROI on those initiatives.
Digital marketing gets a bad rep because of misconceptions. It's still marketing.
Once a year I flew from South Carolina to Boston to work for a week with the rest of our team in person. I also flew to San Francisco once or twice a year for in-person client meetings. 
Does it show 'No data' or does it show the error icon?  
Select the metric you want and on the right column, above 'Metric' you will see 'Date Range Dimension'. Select the same MMYYYY data type you entered above.  
The it degree might help you figure out some trick stuff in digital marketing... But generally have nothing to do with digital marketing... But if you're out on your own he might figure out some ways to use those skills to get a leg-up or figure out some software that helps you automate something that makes more money while arbitraging.
Let me give you the advice I wish I had gotten: FINISH YOU DEGREE no matter what.  A degree is a giant checkbox that needs to be ticked by the brainless morons that fill so many HR departments.  While you may be thinking now you want to be a business owner for the rest of your life, having a degree will make it so much easier if you ever do want to go get a job somewhere else.  
...And don't bother with an MBA.  They are on their way out...I don't honestly know why anyone gets MBAs anymore or even hires these people.  Most successful people I know hate working with MBAs because they basically have two tools in their belt:  cutting costs, and outsourcing.  MBAs destroy companies.  If you ever do decide to go for masters, take a few extra classes and switch to a Masters in Marketing, not a Marketing MBA.
Lastly, having a degree in IT will make you a perfect candidate to do marketing for the IT industry.  The highest paid marketers are extremely niche-focused and have strong backgrounds within their niche.  I'd rather hire someone with an IT degree who learned digital marketing on the side, than a person with a marketing degree who knows nothing about IT.  
What do they like, how do they talk, creative guidelines.
Be aware that asking your client what they want is different than asking "what business problem do you need solved?" 
For example, a client who insisted they needed to get more website traffic actually needed to tweak the code on their shopping cart. They had the right amount of traffic but their website was impossible to use.  
Clients who are not marketing experts can accurately tell you the results they want, and need your help in figuring out how to achieve those results.
Congrats but what exactly you asking
Figuring out what you want from the incoming people will help figure out where to look and how to bring them in.
FWIW one man musician operations aren't that unusual, with loopers and/or backing tracks you could certainly do something live. There are a ton of opportunities for amateur musicians to play so to eliminate that as an avenue of developing a reputation or following seems pretty short-sighted, to me. Those events cost you nothing but your time.
Come in and watch me play at ______ and receive a $10 drink voucher
There are Instagram accounts that repost content from other accounts to make fun oh them. Even these only get some of their content deleted (if the original creators and their followers report it) but rarely banned. So Instagram does not seem to have an issue with reposting.
Digital marketing is such a broad term and the roles within each company vary immensely.  
Senior marketing director here ( 6 years) - typically 3 hours of work generate about one day of productivity so i spend the first 3 days of the week working (8 hours each day minus lunch)  and the rest of the week analyzing data so by the end of the week I am quiet ahead. Lot's of spreadsheets, content calendars and scrum meetings every morning. Productivity tools and actionable items help a lot. I believe in breaking the day into sprints with one 10 minute break every hour. It's really not about the quantity of hours worked but the quality of your work and how you can complete your tasks as effectively as possible. A lot of my habits i derived from playing chess where you wanna make your moves as economical yet as effective as possible so your positioning is always favorable by the end game.
I also have a tendency to take work home with me.
10 hours? Occasionally I get burnt out and “slack off” but even that just means I’m looking at stuff on social media or reading digital marketing articles.
Depend on work, as we are agency so it's compulsory to attain office regular, sometimes weekend too.
I work at a small agency. We haven’t been “slow” in over a year. So I’m working about 7.5 hours/day on average. I always have more work to do than I can get to in a day. But our company culture emphasizes work life balance, so if an employee is consistently putting in more than 40 hours/week there’s often a rebalancing of workloads (or generous bonuses/salary increases).
I am a digital marketing manager for over 80 hotels and I work 8 straight hours minimum 5 days a week.
Talking from experience Do not do MBA in Digital marketing also the coaching institutes who provide certifications are not worth at all. If you really interested in digital marketing then dive in practical go buy domain start blogging or you can start on blogger for free then after some experience you would know what to do."certification won't help" knowledge and experience will certainly do. Goodluck
as someone who has been in this field successfully for over 11 years I'm not even to sure how but digital marketing degree would be relevant. 
I literally have a complete sea change in my business model at least once a year.
Digital marketing is more about problem solving, initiative and persistence.... Yes you need to be somewhat bright and be able to think creatively... The rest of the skills you can learn online mostly for free or find a mentor..... Or if you want to go to the agency route were you just handle people's basic needs without needing to get them results..... You know setting up SEO basic email basic web page then just go for working for a company that does that and learn why you get paid what they are doing..... Hint hint mostly offshoring all that work and closing accounts and keeping on top of their offshore workers....
When you are really good at digital marketing you don't work for somebody else because you have the skill position and all you need is an internet connection and a computer to make money....You don't even need a computer to public library will give you them for free for a week at a time....
As someone who went to grad school before really diving into digital marketing, no it's not worth it at all.  
I'd wait until you reach a point in your career where a masters will help you get the next promotion. That day probably won't ever come, since this is a field judged by results more than credentials.
IMO, on-the-job experience is what's most valuable for you right now. Internships, entry level marketing jobs, etc. Build a portfolio, get some professional references, find out what you like to do, and earn some money.
I would suggest that you do a "techy" masters, data analytics, IT, web dev something like that. 
In my opinion MSc is definitely worth it.
I am just about to start MSc IT as it gives me more insight into related programming. Moreover, I live in a city with 4 large universities and a huge college. There are more than 500 applications for every marketing internship which makes it almost impossible to get and MSc can get you just a little bit farther. 
Anyway, all the people I spoke with who did MSc told me that it is definitely worth it (UK here).
Depends on your desired career path. If your goal is to run a $100m departmentb for a major brand than it would help you achieve that role.
The best and quickest way to get people visiting your site is utilising Google Ads (search or display predominantly) and leveraging keywords/SEO/targeting to display ads to your ideal customers, attracting them to your site (this method is a lot more likely to lead to legitimate customers and grow your user base, ultimately that’s business: gotta spend money to make money).
Since you are already showing up on page 2 or 3 of search results for these keywords, there's a likelihood with some work you could rank higher and get more traffic from them.
I was a CS major student back in the day, and got my first job as a marketing specialist in digital marketing, and moved to project management later. 
You don’t really learn digital marketing in school, so the major isn’t that important. In my company, the marketing department has to kinds of jobs. One is play with Facebook and/or google adwords accounts, which require experiences which you can get once you start your job. The other one is more like project management, you need to communicate with ppl a lot, and need to know all the things relate to digital marketing and  the project you are working on. 
From my experience, ppl majoring in CS, math and statistics may even have an advantage sometime. 
I’m not sure if I answers your question. Can me if you want to know more.
Digital marketing has become far easier in the last 5 years, from when I started you 100% needed to understand coding. These days you only need a digital marketing platform. 
I mayors in marketing and just got my first full-time job in digital marketing a month ago for a Ecommerce startup. For starters, knowledge in CS and statistics help alot in number-crunching and differentiating good and bad KPIs in FB business, GA, Google ads. The last digital marketer before me was in such sense and her previous campaigns was efficient with many metrics that she tested and compared. 
I have been doing paid search for 4 years. Research this carefully before you choose this career path. If you go work for an agency (which is where most of the work is) you may have a heavy workload, long nights, terrible employers, bad benefits, bad pay etc. You are not going to make good money unless you become a director $100k+ or somehow figure out how to make a % of the client's media spend.
Doing SEO is a precarious situation because it's difficult to prove the worth of SEO unlike with paid search.
Paid search is difficult because you're dealing with other people's money. So they want to see a really good return on their investment while combating so many issues like rising cpcs.
My colleagues who do programmatic think it's difficult getting quick decisions, all the digital assets quickly and ever shifting demands.
Front end coding/tracking/test setup is light work in the coding world, but combining it with marketing knowledge and tactics can make it a powerful hybrid roll.
Downside is that many jobs are at agencies, and not all companies actively test.
Just a thought. It is how I salvaged a really weird life path, lol.
Agencies are desperate for help these days. They are willing to hire people that don't have that much experience but rather good knowledge about digital marketing concepts. You already have the certifications, which shows the employer that you care about learning.
But like others have said, apply to a marketing agency. I started out that way, learned ALOT, they also are willing to teach you too. It can elevate your marketing career. Don't expect to make a lot of money right away, but in two years I gained so much knowledge and doubled my salary.
How about taking up internships? That's the easiest doorway to establish yourself for a digital marketing role within any company;  Try it for 2-3 months, learn as much as you can and do your best to impress, if they like you, quite likely you'll get converted to full time. as an intern, people expect less from you, so this is the best time for you to shine!
I got into digital marketing at an entry level by knowing someone is the business, however another person came on right before me as an intern, because of his eagerness to succeed  and the work he put in, he was offered a full time position within 2-3 months... just a little encouragement, give it a try!
Just wanted to wish you best of luck, I’m in the same boat!! I’m currently a Spanish/ESOL teacher but want this to be my last year, aka I want to be done teaching in June and start a new job in August. I’ve been studying on my own like crazy. It’s nerve-wracking to think about job searching in a completely new field, but this post makes me feel hopeful. Best of luck to you!!!
It IS possible. I was in the exact same situation about 8 months ago. It took me about 2 months after leaving my current job at the time to learn everything I could about digital marketing, which might seem too short a time to learn about DM, but since I had a background in marketing/advertising (being a communication arts graduate), everything I studied within the 2-month time frame was easy to digest.
ROI/ROAS. Same as every year!
I would want to see repeat users increasing that were sourced first in social, too.
Apply. There definitely isn’t a shortage of jobs. Do know there’s high turn over and it’s not as glamorous as you think.
If you're an SEO professional offering SEO services, you need to be using the paid tools, in general. There's a reason they cost money. I don't really use any free tools, except gtmetrix or builtwith.com
Look on a site called "siftery'
Ubersuggest by Neil Patel, they just added a bunch of new features.
Just remember that while it might “work” you should evaluate the benefit for the effort. Most of the time, BING’s contribution to the business is so small that the effort outweighs the benefit.
Try Udemy or Lynda for digital marketing courses. when you buy Udemy courses, make sure you wait for the discount 'season' (which is ever 2 weeks and gives you 90% off lol). not sure if that applies for lynda too though.  
but yeah hubspot and GA work well as a base too. get the GAIQ certification while you're at it.
I use it myself. Gave Access to my VA, and he's building links for me based on the guides.
It's a lag across the board, because it's waiting for the browser to open and process the request. In my experience linktree doesn't fix the speed issue.
Just finish the degree to avoid any future barriers. Also, it  supports that you're educated, able to finish a project to the end, well written, etc. Etc.
If you can't communicate why your Communications degree is a good thing, maybe you missed a key module.
Not worth it.
The job market changes all the time, what’s in demand now will not be in demand forever. A college degree will help you be more resilient to market changes. Done right, the experience will also help you grow as a person.
For context, in my company, I only hire people with degrees. It's not PC but there are some places that won't give you a chance without one. Get it over with.
My boss just got a job as a Communications Manager making like 6 figures (5 years experience) I think it’s worth it!
Having the degree will help you a lot in the long run - not getting it could be the worse decision you ever made.

Happy to help. Pm me?
I’ve done some consultancy with brands before.

\- Google Analytics: this allows you to see all conversions except facebook and Linkedin post-impression. It also allows you to deduplicate your facebook and linkedin conversions. The top conversion paths and model attribution comparison can help you, but it won't track when a facebook and linkedin ad impact only with impressions;
Another option is that you can get another phone number for them, use only that number in your ads so that they can see how many calls they get from ads.
I just got a job in digital marketing having only taken 5 marketing classes. I am the first digital marketer for a healthcare clinic. I do not think that opportunities are running out. If anything they are increasing. As for training, I do have a degree in communication. You can do things on your own like getting certified in Google AdWords.
It's never too late.
I still can't fathom why anyone who is skilled enough to run good campaigns doesn't jump to affiliate marketing and  just work for themselves.
Never too late. Land an interview for an entry level job and prove your work ethic. You'll learn everything along the way. I've hired folks with no experience compared to those with tons. You can't teach work ethic and unfortunately this business is filled with way too many entitled and lazy folks who don't care to learn or stay late to be team players.
If you really ineterested in  digital marketing industry, it's never to late. And you don't need to take a university course to become an expert, actually.  But if you want it because of ease and popularity you may be disappointed in the process of studying/working
It’s never too late, if anything now is a great time to get into digital. But it’s far from easy!
It's never too late to do anything... unless you're trying to enter a kids talent show at age 40
It's absolutely not too late!
In fact, it's the perfect time. There has never been an easier time to get online and break into the digital space.
Sure, there's more competition than there was 5 years ago, but with the right attitude and hard work you can soar above the rest because they don't have the drive.
I myself started digital marketing 2 years ago after locking myself away from the world for almost a decade.
I now earn 5 figures a month from affiliate marketing and have traveled the world speaking on stage about my transformation. 
It's never too late! :)
Tons of businesses out there without any competent marketing departments.
Too late? No this is the beginning  Google has only been round since  1996 and Facebook since 2004. Digital marketing is at an early stage although it moves extremely quickly with new and more advanced tools being introduced on a seemingly daily basis. In fact it moves so quickly that small businesses cant keep up. Added to that things like SEO, SSL certificates GDPR, Facebook pixels are all things that in allot of cases are being overlooked and opportunities within this niche.
Please note that nothing is easy, you have to work hard and put your best efforts. Once you become proficient in your any field you will get ample of good opportunities.
1. Learn just the basics of Google Analytics [https://analytics.google.com/analytics/academy/](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/academy/) . Not just to understand how your marketing efforts are going but also to ensure that your agency is not manipulating data while reporting. 
4. You will only need Facebook & Insta. Twitter is a plus, but if you have to pay extra for that don't. Twitter is exclusively for political battles, at least here in India.
6. Instgram is going to be your best friend, close second is Facebook. Make sure your agency has extremely good graphic designers, because image is everything, everything is image (rockstar)
Other then that, you can PM me if you have any specific question.
You have taken right decision by hiring digital marketing agency. You can do below activities to promote your new website.
Hey buddy i am also from india.
Happy to help
I don't know about Tumblr but I'm pretty sure Reddit and Quora are only nofollow links.
It still can be worth posting on these sites to build awareness especially within your niche, but I don't think it's worthwhile for linkbuilding.
So only using Quora and Reddit is not enough. 
Remember, backlinks are like votes - not all of them are created equal. You can have a random account posting thousands of comments with a link to a website or reliable blogger post 2 via his website, guess which one is going to have more impact? One random person saying that drinking water is important or Joe Rogan saying the same thing, who is going to have more impact?
Google Docs + EverNote + Google Calendar and iOS Calendar synched up.  I'm also super OCD in terms of staying organized, but I don't necessarily spend a lot of time (or any money at all) to do so.
The most important tip is to break down your tasks to smaller tasks - put them in your calendar and work on it!
I use a bullet journal! I used normal planners religiously in school but most of them weren't quite the right format for work
Remember the milk is an amazing tool and not just for work. I use it to manage all of my tasks, for today, tomorrow and into the future. Highly recommend, but you have to be religious about using it across all platforms. 
I used to use wunderlist but it wouldn’t load when I was on the subway. Remember the milk is way more stable and does a better job of syncing across multiple platforms.
I use Monday - and I have a notebook with a table of contents that I carefully keep track of for different topics...kinda like a bullet journal but not really
I will not work without Asana. It’s better if a team uses it but it’s quite useful on its own as well.
Trello for tasks, Drive for file storage and documents, Slack for chat. my team haven’t invested into any schedulers yet so i just use Facebook for scheduling.
am I a dork for emailing myself to do lists before I close for the day?
Physical agenda to write out notes so I can write everything down as it comes. 
Social media scheduling tools 
For short term projects I can add other people to my list, create tasks with sub tasks, add notes to my tasks and upload related files to each. I also have tasks for personal things like groceries since I have the app on my phone and can add them on the fly.
In the past I have also used .txt files. And Trello. And Wunderlist. All systems worked. But Outlook Calendar plus Confluence seems to work the best for me.
Get an entry level job and/or find a small business client to work for.
Is to learn new skills
Super cool that you love digital marketing! It’s crazy that in the past 3 years I’ve gone from being targeted by fashion ads to webinars on Facebook advertising - says a lot about how my personal interests have changed, and my love for digital marketing!
If you have a family member or a friend who has a their own business volunteer to do some digital marketing for a couple of hours a week. No one in their right mind could say no to some good digital marketing. Even if it’s some content marketing and basic SEO. There’s so many tools that offer freemium which could get you so far.
I did brand, digital, community, social and more for AAA games over the last decade. Shoot me a DM.
Feel free to message me :)
Tell them to suck a fat one
I licensed a vid yo storyful. They gave me some $ every few months, but it wasn't from YouTube. I think it was from Facebook views or allowing news stations to play it. 
You’re on the right platform if you want to brush up your skills. I learn so much weaving in and out of comments on Reddit. 
The number 1 way to improve your skills is to just apply whatever you’ve learned into practice, but evolve your own techniques.
linkedin (understand more in business perspective), 
Ads don't necessarily go to people in your data base but rather people you tell Google to target.
I am a digital marketer and have been so for about 8 years. Google adwords has always been something I provide my clients.
Recently within the last 2 years, roughly, I'd say a year to be fair, Adwords, to me, has become a nightmare. Their customer service reps are as nice as can be, but never know what's going on. It takes me weeks and often multiple conversations with adwords reps to get campaigns going. 
My question: am I the idiot that just doesn't know anything or couldn't keep up with adwords fast changing pace or are they seriously screwed up over there at headquarters? Every campaign seems to be a giant pain in the you know what. It is unsettling what I have to do to get a campaign launched these days. I am asking if others experience this and Google has really dropped the ball or am I just a "rookie" that thinks he knows what he's doing because he's been in the game for so long.
If you want to work for a major corporation then the DS is the way to go since you need to make sense of data on the fly. 
It goes without saying that, it all depends on the country and the industry you want to target / penetrate. 
Have you tried LinkedIn ads?
Google Adwords have been working on their algorithms to determine "quality leads" to your website, to essentially filter out those low budget customers that you don't want. 
It can take a few weeks for the machine learning to be carried out - Especially if you haven't used PPC much before. With campaigns like shopping you can assign target ROAS to get the ball rolling for the machine learning. 
Of course SEO is always best, since it's the free traffic. There's no reason why you can't work on both.
Personally, I'm on the side of any "Self Made Digital Marketing Guru" is full of shit, and they are the biggest problem with the digital marketing industry right now. Most of these guys build libraries of courses/classes/videos/etc. and give away a lot of 101 level knowledge for free, then charge you for more info. But that "more info" never really comes. 
Their entire business model is not built on being digital marketing gurus - it's selling their courses to new people in the industry. Hell, many of these (like dropshipping courses) end with the guy telling you to start your own courses, and around we go. (I guess in that vein, they are good at what they do). 
If you really want to learn more about digital marketing and make a career out of it, I'd start with the basic resources online, including content from the platforms themselves (Google, Facebook, etc.). 
I was in a similar position two years ago, no experience, but I really wanted to try out digital marketing. I did one and a half unpaid internships. They were pretty easy to find in my area. Then from there I sat down one day and applied/sent emails to every local marketing agency that I could find, even if they didn’t have job openings posted. A small one contacted me a month later and hired me. I learned so much there and made amazing connections that have helped propel me. I’d recommend trying something similar before going straight into freelance work by yourself. Learning on the job from people with more experience is just so much more valuable than a paid online course in my opinion. 
Lynda.com. Aim for getting a full time job ASAP. Then pay for better and better courses, from reputable providers like Udacity. 
Are you prepared to cover an angry client's overspend when you screw up and go 3x over their budget? This happens with even experienced marketers. What happens when they start asking you slightly more than basic questions about what is happening or what else they can do and you stutter on the call and they realize you don't know wtf you're doing? 
The dream isn't dead but it isn't easy. You need big-fish clients that are going to see through an amateur and never give them a chance. You won't be able to do it with clients paying you $400 a month. At that point you might as well work at a company and get the perks that come with it as well.
Do outreach to get traffic back to you. 
Congratulations man. I'm having trouble finding a digital marketing internship, I can't imagine how hard it is to find a job.
Keep learning. Never stop learning. Marketing is ever changing and there is no such a thing as staying at the same knowledge level. If you are not going ahead, you are losing ground.
Well man, good luck. I just got recently hired too as an SEO analyst. My pay is $35,000 but I live in an area with low expenses. Also, my concern was more about just getting into the industry. That and I'm working with one of the best experts in the field. 45,000 in New Jersey might be a bit difficult to live on tho. I was interviewing with a company in New Jersey a few months back for a PPC position and I was in the final stage. If I had gotten hired, I would have had a $53,000 salary.
I would personally ask the hiring manager about the living expenses of New Jersey, then ask him what he thinks is acceptable for the low and high range of the job's salary taking those expenses into account. He could end up raising your salary as a result. You never know.
Also keep in mind that there are two reasons they hired you. Reason one is because they thought you were the best fit of course. But reason number two is because they can't find anyone with your talent in the state. 
Recent marketing grad here so sorry if this is a taboo question, but is 45k a common rate for a specialist position in NJ? That’s more or less my base rate going into coordinator positions out in WA. 
Nice work and congrats! Learn as much as you can, ask to learn what others are working on. Super beneficial as you want to move up the ranks in marketing. 
* Metrics: visits, pages/visit, e-commerce conversion rate etc. You can choose more metrics if you like
I'd also suggest not focusing on clicks as a KPI. Instead, look for conversions.
Finally, test it yourself to see if a redirect is chopping some of the UTM-parameters so all the traffic in Google Analytics is counted as Direct.
Strange enough, I've found heat mapping tools that record visitor interaction (like HotJar) to be super accurate, as they're activated by movement (scrolling) and track how many seconds someone spends on a page.  Meaning, they ignore bot traffic and people who don't stick around long enough for the page to load, but include most all human interactions.
I was in this position before. It will help to start slow and show the decision-maker the value of your approach. 
Sat down and recommended the owner do 10 things in the long run but 2 things immediately. He reviewed my list and we chose 2 actions to take for now. 
It allowed the owner to see what I was doing. I walked him through the results like search ranking and Facebook ad conversion. Once he knew I wasn't wasting money, he'd greenlight the next marketing task.
Also do note that traffic is not the same as leads.
You can send cheap traffic with google ads \[display\] but your conversion rates will be abysmal even though your CPC will be 0.01 \[if done right\].
Yes, Facebook has much better-targeting options and an overall less cost per conversion on average. I would recommend using both those because you can hit people from two different areas search/social media and the more you get your ads out the more people will start to recognize and associate your ads to your business. Thus, increasing brand awareness.
For one of my client I used to spend around ₹10,000 and was able to get 10-13 conversions. Due to competition the bidding has increased heavy which lead to high Top Page Bid. So it was simply not sustainable. CPA was around 800-1000. 
So I setup FB ads campaign with ₹5000 for testing phase. I was able to get good traffic and leads. Then I shifted my entire budget to FB and IG. Today with same amount I am able to get 100 leads or more. The quality of traffic of traffic and leads is high and closing rate has seen growth. 
Portfolios are everything. Agencies often want people with developed skill-sets so they can pitch new services in their client packages, and in-house positions at large companies usually want a proven track record since a poor social media campaign can be very damaging to their image.
I'd suggest looking at local shops, restaurants, and small businesses that are severely lacking on their social media. A lot of small business accounts are run by the owners or by the youngest kid in the company, and would gladly take cheap social media help 1-2 days a week. Identify these businesses, research their local competitors and how they leverage social media, and show up in person and ask to talk about it (be prepared to leave a card). Score 1 or 2 clients, and utilize them to build a portfolio to help win an agency or in-house job down the road (or maybe you'll find you like freelancing).
Don't be discouraged- this is a very bloated field and entry level jobs are often soaked up by overqualified applicants. Just keep growing your skillset, portfolio, and network.
Depending on how large your agency is, make sure their manager is mentoring them, having regular check-ins with them, and giving feedback on their work. Also give them a "buddy" who isn't their manager/ideally outside of their direct department/team who they grab coffee with regularly. This allows the interns to have a more informal relationship with someone who can answer questions they might be too embarrassed to ask their manager. I'm an intern-turned full time employee at an agency, so feel free PM me if you have any questions! Happy to talk.
You can get pretty much anything with a valid credit card just do all your research before the free trial expires or get a refund within 30 days - if you need more than 30 days to get all your research done you're not doing it right.
Any free backlink analysis tool that you guys know of. A tool that atleast shows all the linking domains for free. 
Thanks! in the right 
I think there are still many...!
Varies depending on the account. There's never a one size fits all. 
He requires that I jack him off every now and then. >!Because I am the Manager!<.
Jokes apart
Well, you have two options.
First, if you take an entry level position at an agency or company, culturing a natural relationship with an experienced digital marketer you respect is ideal (and that person respects you back as well). Just like any industry. 
Computer science imo is a more important skill that college can teach you. The other stuff you're better off learning elsewhere. The marketing degree I got was largely useless except for signaling "hey, I have the ability to sit in class for 4 years and do what is expected of me." Which is a decent signal to an employer, but it held little weight in the job market. 
I think that skills matter more than universities in my opinion. There are a lot of fields like programming for example that usually only want you to know the language. But still, having a degree won't hurt you. The more you learn about how economy works, the better. Surprisingly, The History of the Economy made me change my perspective and see things in a new way. Actually I think that this applies in every field.
Either could work. From my perspective those who can write code are in higher demand but those who can manage people are also employed widely. It’s more about personal preference. If you enjoy building relationships, frequent small talk, and interacting with people marketing management will be more relevant to what you do well. If you enjoy data and problem solving more than people, computer science is the better choice.
I graduated with a degree in Business Information Technology - half business, half computer science. I learned how to code, how to analyze and solve business problems, but most importantly how to combine my technical and business skills to solve problems and communicate issues clearly.
CS will give you much more technical knowledge, but depending on the program it can be way overkill for going into digital marketing. CS at my university was in the engineering school, so everyone also had to take things like basic electrical engineering which were hugely irrelevant for some. Marketing management is way closer to what you want to do later, but will probably leave you with fewer technical skills. That said you can learn basic web dev and design skills on your own. 
But do get a degree. Even if it's not in marketing...
That's a great question, it made me pause for some time and look back at everything I've done in digital marketing.
For me personally it would be CRO, conversion rate optimization.
Could be marketing automation as well. I could learn HTML/CSS/Java much earlier too.
It's hard to know without more campaign specifics, and your goals, but it sounds like you might want to explore some optimizations.
Edit: you stated ecomm, I missed that originally
I not sure how you are doing that but you need to use the business manager for all you campaigns.  That is were all tools are.
Yeah, I do the same, unless u run ads on multiple fanpages andeach has multiple admins
Yes. Business Manager will be helpful. I rarely go to our business page directly
3. We don't but PPC hero is a good place to start.
you need Google Ads and Google Analytics - together they do what you want and so much more
do a course and learn it asap
Re: #1, what you're asking for is basically a CRM, ad integration, and e-comm oriented email marketing software all in one.
We start with the budget - if they have previous ad spend we stick with that budget unless they want to increase. My typical strategy is starting small, testing ads/creatives/copy/audiences, and scaling up the good ads to meet the budget as long as performance stays good. 
Get certified in Google Analytics and Adwords. My interviewer was impressed that I was certified in one of those. You can also work with a recruiter to help you get a job. I'm in the same boat as you, all my experience in marketing has been in social media and I'm trying to branch out to other areas of marketing.
Thank you, guys! This helps!
I think there are no analysis and statistical software that provides insights for Whatsapp. Whatsapp Marketing is great as it helps you reach many individuals at no cost. But you can't understand to whom it have been to and whom not. Like Hubspot and others software provide services etc.
It’s not too late. I am in a hurry now, but will post later. 
Not too late at all. It’s hard to give specific advice for which area to focus in right now but getting a general marketing exec position should be OK and will give you exposure to what it’s like to work in this industry and whether you want to pursue it further.
To get you started, you should look at perhaps getting a Google Analytics certification or Hubspot inbound marketing. Also check out the Moz Academy if you can. These are all free and will help you brush up on your general skills whilst also showing employers that you’re serious about the switch. Definitely do not buy a course though! You really don’t need to.
If you’re struggling to find work initially then you could speak to the company where you currently work to see if they have any open positions in the marketing department. I initially started out by asking to help our marketing team with just a few hours a week. Eventually I was able to increase this over time and after that I had enough experience to go into interviews with something to talk about. 
I have a master's degree in finance. I went from working at banks to working at a tech company to now breaking into digital marketing.
Run the other way, fast. Go back to the bank. You have it way better than you think.
Not too late at all, especially if you’re ok with more entry level positions, but are you ready for the likely salary drop?
I haven't studied marketing at all yet I am in the industry. Here's my story. 
I've got a degree in journalism, an industry that's an asshole to get into especially if you, such as myself, are an immigrant. By a mere chance I landed myself a job in what I thought was PR, but my responsibilities were mostly running social media - what can I say, the company was Chinese. As a matter of fact, it closed down within month and a half.
So, I've started a job hunt again. Whenever I was attempting to get a job in PR, my little bubble was starting to burst as some employers explained to me my previous experience belonged in digital marketing department rather than PR. So, this way I've began applying for Digital Marketing instead while still being a journalism grad with 1.5 months experience in 'PR'. 
Needless to say no one was willing to give me a job. On the other hand, I've been offered a paid 3 months internship. While I worked for a bare minimum, the amount of experience gained is insufferable and lead me to further progression later on. 
So, I didn't even plan on reprofiling into Digital Marketing nor had interest or sufficient knowledge to it other than social media maintenance experience and basic knowledge of SEO and wordpress. 
It is a very easy industry to get into, even if you haven't studied it. As long as you're a fast learner, you will most definitely succeed.

Hi  I'm interested to find out more. My team and I run a weight loss supplement in the US. We spend about USD3-4K everyday. Thanks! 
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:
I don't think there's anything that will let you look back 5 years,  but Iconosquare has good analytics for IG. 
I think the compensation is already happening in the form of sending us more update emails about the outage than I ever wanted. 
Most likely not since it'll be somewhere deep in the contract about uptime percentage and even with 2 days of delayed outage, they're still VERY high. 
hubspot has an entire academy that’s completely free and incredible. hootsuite also has free courses with certifications online that are very respected. 
So cool..I was a Graphic Designer too but shifted to Digital Marketing cause my keen interest was in Marketing using digital tools. So there are wide ways you can learn Digital Marketing but not limited to.!!!! The Best Courses & Certification are provided by : Google(Free), FB(Free), Twitter(Free), LinkedIn(Subscription Package)...You should start with Learning Fundamentals Concept of Marketing !!! Then going to Terms in BasicTerm in Digital Markets,SEO, Content Marketing, AdWords, Pages&Promotion !!! So I would suggest you to follow pathways provided by LinkedIn as it is much definitive way for a Marketing Course...And do read GaryVee's book :Crushing It...All The Best...Just Do it,!!! For more feel free to contact me in Msg
No matter whatever course you take whether it is Facebook, Instagram there is one thing that you need to know and practice, copywriting skills, without it, you will have very little success. Knowing how to create ads is one thing, know how to create ads and landing pages that convert is a whole different story. My suggestion is to get started with learning copywriting. When I first started SEO and created an affiliate site to review digital pianos, I was getting 35 to 50K visitors per month to my site but converting very few visitors to click to the merchant. I was at a turning point, Get more traffic or learn to convert the traffic I already had. I opted to learn to convert existing traffic and I am glad I did learn to write conversion copy. Talk to any experienced digital marketer and they will say the same.
So buddy keep your work up. All the best.
You can post links on Pinterest which is a big advantage over Instagram. I find traffic time on site is much higher too. I only started using it recently but seems good so far.
For the female demographic and B2C companies, it seems to work quite well. It's a bit time consuming, but can be good if you stick with it and have a strategy in place. Additionally, the advertising is quite cheap still to get your pins seen.
4. And I would suggest you to use Pinterest ... It will help you somehow or either, just it help you to be better and understand this platform too.. Just see to it, that strategy is well enough you to get start. 
The only time people share their secrets is when they get something out of it, which usually means they want to sell you something.
If it’s just normal stuff like “how do I install a tracking pixel” or “how do I make a landing page” etc then it could work I guess, but that information is also easily available on Google.
Sorry I don’t mean to burst your bubble, but I’ve seen a few of these ideas come and go without working out as expected.
Depends. If I'm looking for a quick tip for some thing I'm somewhat familiar with I'll do a few Google searches until I find something I feel was helpful. If it's a more advanced topic or if I couldn't find the answer to what I was looking for originally ill check Udemy and then maybe Lynda.
Im not necessarily active on online communities as I prefer to study online courses or books, but this is something I'm looking to change. I definitely see the value in this kind of interaction but most of the time I'll like an answer now and will use this community to answer questions I can't find answers to else where or just to learn how others approach certain aspects of digital marketing.  Its hard to tell how helpful this will be to my career but I can for sure see it being helpful to some degree.
In regards to Digital marketing I'm part of a few communities from some Udemy courses I purchased but I rarely check them. I do however check my web Development communities as I have an interest in the subject and I also attend wordcamp every year. I also check stack overflow of course.
Attention to detail. I swear this the cause of like 90% of the flameouts I’ve seen. If you don’t have this skill you need to learn from those who do. Paying attention to IOs and budget pacing is so so important. Also a good tip someone once gave me was to build my own checklists and incorporate them into my workflow — super useful when building SEM campaigns for example. 
Resources  to learn are udemy and different blogs (just google)
I work for a media company that publishes numerous websites. We have agency relationships but they’re buyers of our inventory not true partners like you’re saying. We have various teams tasked with managing our technology stack and yield management is a huge part of what they do. They analyze all the sell side ad tech and make decisions but there aren’t really intermediaries it’s a direct relationship between us and the ad tech vendors. 
Many ad ops outsource shops do similar things, but each has its own flavor and implementation. Publishers sometimes will try out different solutions, but often they will only move if something is not going as well as they’d hoped. 
This one is easy. Here’s something I did about a year ago. 
I unfollowed all the useless shit. I unfollowed the meme pages, sports, celebrity’s, trash news, etc. I kept only my close friends, family, co-workers. Most importantly, I followed successful entrepreneurs, motivational speakers, brands I want to gain inspiration from, financial advice, etc. 
Social media often gets a bad rep. But it’s not social media, it’s the people and the things you follow. Your phone (and subsequently, social media) counts as one of the five people your spend the most time with in your life. This means you’re greatly impacted by the things you do on your phone. 
Create your social media environment into something constructive. Since I did this, I actually spend far less time on social media. I’m not always in the mood to scroll through my timeline anymore. But that’s a good thing. 
I am a digital marketing manager and it depends on which aspect of digital marketing you want to work in. If you want to paid media then yes, need to understand how social works and purchased. Or if you want to go into analytics, you may need to know how the data works for social media. Or you can go into ad ops (just implementing campaigns) or go into strategy. Don’t need to know a whole bunch but just how it is used for the overall strategy of the brand. But still nice to know. 
Posting and building social accounts is a pain and something I dislike, but I do the above often and is beneficial.
1: you don't *have* to do anything. You should be using the channels that are most appropriate/most profitable for your business. On social in particular, people think they have to be everywhere,  and keep pumping out content all the time. You could just as easily put one ad on Facebook and keep it running for 3 months, and do nothing else. If it works, it works. 
2: social for business is not like social for personal use. Your audience may behave in ways that are completely contrary to the way you behave on social. Use numbers and analytics to see what works. If it is for a business, then social media should always have a clear tie to your business - whether thats a product, a service, facilities, people... social should be messaging that you have a clear reason for putting out, and thatnprovides specific value for the customer. You don't even need to follow any other sources if you don't want to, as long as what you are doing makes sense and has a clear objective. 
Hell no. I've been an affiliate marketer that specializes in email marketing for over 11 years and I've won awards in the industry and I'm a 7 figure earner and my Instagram account has maybe two hundred people. While social media can be an effective tool nothing beats knowing you make x amount of dollars spending x amount of dollars and that just won't happen with posting on social media. Hit me up if you want to learn more but the basics are this dot-dot-dot I collect large email address list through digital marketing I offset my ad cost wall collecting those people at the same time and I monetize it further through email marketing. Most times I post on here I got some haters but the truth is the whole bunch of us that make really good livings doing digital marketing... And we are not influencers and we have been doing this for a long time.
You have to have an incredible understanding of social media and it’s intricacies, as well as trends and sudden changes of tech and direction, because social media is what drives digital marketing trends. 
Google Ads: get certified, it’s free and you’ll learn just about everything you need to know. Also make sure you install Google’s tracking features.
Seems like all the money is in being a "guru" and selling courses. 
I agree with all  who gave valuable suggestions regarding the same but I personally believe find the piece that you really love and you want to do for the whole life. I Personally belive you have money in every domain every field, every industry.
Just check for yourself which industry you think there are no GURU's. Which doesn't make money.
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:
- [/r/webmarketing] [How can I find the most profitable keywords in all topics and industries?](https://www.reddit.com/r/webmarketing/comments/b7ga9x/how_can_i_find_the_most_profitable_keywords_in/)
Profitable is really hard to get at. You'd need to know how much different businesses are making off of each term. 
It would be easier to figure out how expensive they are. 
You aren't going to find a magic bullet solution to find profitability. Tools like Keyword Planner will only be able to show you volumes and relative competitiveness with some CPC metrics. Profitability on paid keywords comes down to a lot of variables, including conversion rate on your site and AOV. One trick I do use though is I will use PPC spy tools like SpyFu to find keywords that top competitors are bidding on and look at how long they have been bidding on them. If its a competitor that I find to be active in their digital marketing efforts, I make the assumption that if they are bidding on a keyword for a long time, then they find success with it.
--->>>And Please!!! Please, Please!!! STOP running ads like 99.9% of realtors run.  And these are ads that blast pictures of themselves everywhere. News Flash: NOBODY WANTS A REALTOR! And nobody cares about your face.  These ads ONLY serve the narcissistic needs of the realtor. Nobody wakes up one day and says, "Let's pack all of our shit into boxes and move."
3.   Ad Copy.... Your ad copy should SPEAK TO THE CLIENT! I see realtors get this wrong all the time.  I see ads copy like " I'll sell your home in 30 days!" Once again this is usually with a picture of the realtor 😟 Use copy that speaks to the client, what their point of view is.  One of my favorite copy techniques for FB is " Your neighbor's house sold in under 48 hours ABOVE market value!
4.    Build Email List. Launch a traffic campaign to a landing page and offer a free home valuation (or something like this) if they sign up for a newsletter. Email is great because it decreases your reliance on paid media, but it is also a valuable data source for targeting. Also stay in contact with past clients! Push your referral program, plus you never know when someone will be ready to move...
Let me know if you have any questions.
Haven't seen this mentioned yet, install a Facebook Pixel on your site to target effectively. It's crucial. 
Does the gallery have a social presence yet? If not, I'll start with that first to bring in some organic traffic. Facebook, Instagram and maybe Pinterest. You can work you way into paid search and social. Content marketing is something I would focus on.
Depends on where their customers hang out online, how customers would interact with an updated business's online presence, and what business problem the business wants solved. 
Sometimes businesses do ok with a crappy web presence because some other factor drives customers to the business. 
Google, FB or Yelp most likely depending on the audience and business. 
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram. But you need to develop different strategies for them. Don't approach as just social media platform. You will have different audiences on all 3 of them.
whichever your desired audience is on.  start doing your research.
I would have used Facebook and Instagram....Building two different strategies for each one of them.With Instagram rolling out its shopping feature in the app itself it would be much more desirable to work much on it. Tumblr or PinInterest, surely depends on what people mostly use this platform (Like what % or no.s of them use it).If FB have more users in the area and particular age group you want to market then FB will be No.1 Priority (Just Taking FB as an Example for building Priority)...but whatever social media you use...The Strategy you apply see to it that, it needs to be applied at Right Time, Right Area, Right Place and Right Group
Create a business page on instagram and facebook . You can use paid promotion option on social media to gain more traffic . It is completely affordable and best to boom our business .
Create buyer personas. Who would buy your product or services, what pain points do you solve, what are their jobs titles, what business sizes does your product/services work best, etc. When you piece together all these questions, it will help you figure out where these people hangout. 
This post alarms me. Is this a joke?
Try to define kpi’s for your agency campaigns. Since many of the brands we worked with did not have direct ecommerce but would instead go through distributors we often had “branding” campaigns which were easy to execute, but then the results were left up for interpretation by the client and if sales didn’t improve 2 months down the road we were blamed. 
Agree with /u/j03c0nn01, fill in the gap with a position of doing your own thing and talk about it as a time for you to discover whether you want to go out on your own or not, and then you can conclude with finding that you missed working with a larger team, etc. and so are returning.
Lived in Melbourne for a while.... doing PPC for Telstra. Maybe see if they are hiring for their offices in CBD. Otherwise, getting a job is about going out and meeting people, networking and finding out about jobs that way. Recruiters are usually the last place I have gone to get a job.
Second, is it important that your software is in that location? If it's a software cannot not be used anywhere within a radius? Is the latter, mentioning the location is probably unnecessary.
Running email marketing and marketing automation (MA) is a skill, tech & tools come and go. Knowing how to target people, do it right and run a/b tests is a skill like anything in marketing.
You are probably reaching an offline audience or there's no out of the box targeting for your potential customers. 
Are you using very broad US targeting? This works sometimes for B2C and eComm but depending on the software that could be wasting a ton of time/effort. Facebook tries to show relevant ads to people, so if your ads don't seem very relevant, they won't be shown or clicked on. 
Are you getting any other errors from Facebook about the amount of text in your ads? And are you letting them run long enough that the learning phase completes? Consider keeping placements ONLY in Newsfeed everything else is mostly a waste
Is your Facebook Pixel set up? You can try to drive targeted traffic with interest-based targeting and move onto more targeted audiences once your Pixel is fed well.
4. Upcoming plans if they differ from usual
It sounds cheesy, but the agenda really works to drive alignment and get people working well together. 
As the comments before, 
Have a plan, make small talk and be yourself. I’ve made a lot of great client relationships being myself - cracking jokes and talking about life before hitting the numbers. Those small moments build trust and makes mistakes much easier to admit. 
When talking about performance, go over the numbers, what they mean - compare to industry averages, What’s working/ What’s not , what optimizations you’ve made and recommendations moving forward. 
Shorter the better, they can always convert for longer vids. Without understanding the nature of the video, target audience, role etc all of those platforms seem fine. 
For LinkedIn and Facebook, if you do ads, I'd cut the video down and A/B test length versions. 30-45 seconds seem to work best, but pending the content I've had longer perform better before. But in the ads, you can link to your website or a landing page with a form and a longer video. 
I guess from you posting you don’t believe the video will have enough traction to drive the actual views, don’t be afraid of your intuition or framing how to channel people to want to consume the video to your client.
Are you already tracking your traffic and audience? Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, HubSpot, etc. 
Edit: noticed organic is the focus, ditched some paid recommendations.
To say; "SEO or Google is the way for your clients to find you." is the more accurate explanation than to say  "to find my clients on Google with SEO". It seems both are the same but indeed not. 
The best part of social media is, platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and the others have more details and very large info about the users. This enables you to find more targeted audiences and 
Most of these online course are a waste of money and time.
Just my two cents, but it never hurts to interview and negotiate to make it worth your effort to move to a different role. ($$$)
I work in big tech and Analytics is huge (a lot of money being made in that space) and will only get bigger. PPC won’t die out, but it’s going to keep getting harder to get the results you want. 
I never change jobs unless there’s more money in it for me. If you’re really really excited about analytics, maybe go for it, but it could end up being quite similar to what you’re doing now.
You don't need Digital Sales course to become Google Ads Certified. Not a bad idea to have that certification though
I use google sheets to track a lot of my activity. Example you can have a sheet with the ad and then copy it over to a new cell every time you make a change to the ad copy label it as a new version (3.1 3.2 etc) - this is also useful because you can run a/b tests this way so you know which ad has been performing best
1. The good ole' Google Sheets: Project Management couldn't get simpler than this
While you can always use the channel specific platform to analyze data, it is best to have them all in once place using a project management tool. Alternatively, you can look at BI tools such as Tableau to have all data in one place.
We use Airtable for bigger campaign execution management. For minor changes, I still have an old school notebook! 
Things like adding keywords to already established ad groups, small copy changes are jotted in my notebook as I go. I know, old school, but it works for me. 
"Oh, so you have x problem? When I worked for xyz, I did this to fix x problem for them." Showing interest in their company and their issues is a strong signal that you've done your research, are engaged in the field, and are worth investing time and effort into pursuing. 
I was also very forward about where my experience lacked, and how I'd like to grow to fill those gaps while in that role. I think managers appreciated the transparency and realistically, a lot of the times they'll backtrack and say "oh there actually is very little of xyz responsibility, we just threw that on there to draw more people in". 
I also tend to go into a phone interview with 3 questions (not including pay/benefits queries), again for the purpose of showing that I've done my research and am invested in their business. 
I struggled with phone interviews when I was first starting off in my career. I would tend to talk way too much since I didn't have the visual cue of knowing whether the interviewer was engaged. Scripting out answers to the standard questions (tell me about yourself? what are your strengths/weaknesses?, etc.), recording myself, and listening to those recordings to improve my pace and confidence.
 \* Increased ROI by 25% through optimizing a multi-million dollar digital advertising spend. 
Sounds like a poorly thought through task assignment. Sucks that this is happening when you’re new to the industry. Not the first time I’ve heard of companies taking on interns to do work with no idea of what’s realistically achievable in terms of targets. And they are supposed to be training you to so this, not delegating it to you.
If you can, check out some online courses from places like Digital Marketer etc. which might help.
Wow. I'm sorry this is happening to you. your higher-ups have no idea what they're doing, and the results they're expecting from you, given what you have to work with, are just ridiculous. 
If I were you I would just try to figure out a way to spin this situation as positively as you can so that you can walk away with /some/ experience and have something in your favor to report back from your internship. Create some realistic, manageable goals for yourself at this point so at least you have that to report back. Because given your resources and inexperience you're not going to reach the (insane) company goals. And don't feel bad, it's not your fault.
 I would focus on taking this from a largely bought audience to at least a somewhat engaged one (although easier said than done with no budget). Build a strategy and create a content calendar. Keep up the work on getting leads. At least by the end you can hopefully say that you implemented a new process from the ground-up, brought in leads, and created an engaged community where there was none. 
You have a huge scope of work for your digital marketing - how much of it do you want to hand off? $700K revenue is small enough that little marketing mishaps won't tank your brand, but still large enough that strategy moves can mean the difference in a few hundred thousand $$. 
Standard agency retainers for multi-channel stuff is usually $1k - $5k monthly per channel depending on how much you need (we usually run $1k per channel per month for smaller businesses). Good quality freelance marketers should be around at least $20 -  $40/hour. Much higher for strategy

I have not had experience personally with this model, but some thoughts:
If I was given enough control and visibility I’d consider it. The goal CPL would have to be reasonable enough. I’d forecast the cost per click, expected conversion rate, add my desired margin and if the math works, go for it. If the target cpl is too low for me to make money I’d pass.
You have to set your contract up to get paid on results if you want to make the most money, only do this if you really are good. 
Think of it from a financial POV. They want to know what they are spending their money on, the better the numbers sound mixed with low risk value, ( commission based ) 
Are they looking to get a bunch of cheap leads? 
You can come up with meaningful, and 'good looking' pricing plans for any of those approaches. You could surely generate a ton of clicks, and charge them a good rate for it, and laugh all the way to the bank. But those clicks would likely be poor quality and not turn into revenue for your client. You could charge them the same per lead as you would per click, and work really hard and go broke trying to make your client happy. Or you could find a way to meet in the middle and have a good long term working relationship, but find you may never reach agreement on metrics and price. 
It's bad practice, don't devalue the service itself. 
Manager - usually manages camapign and all the employees working on it. I currently hold this role and I delegate tasks and meet with the client etc etc. (short version)
If you're new I would shoot for analyst and or coordinator. I would not hire ANYONE without at least 2 yrs experience. I have been in this industry for about ten years now and have seen plenty of people come and go. You need the experience with clients not just with the execution of the campaign. In my opinion that is where the value of experience comes in.
Digital marketing is a vast field which has many things like SEO, SMO, SEM, SMM, Content marketing, Understand the market etc. In the end I would like to say that a beginner should start from one by one.
Look at the requirements for marketing - analyst, executive, marketer, assistant jobs. They often end up being the most common titles for people with little experience.
There’s the technical aspect, where you specialise in the technical/operational aspect of DM; eg on-site SEO, coding, web development, executing media buy/PPC etc people within this career track end up as more technical performance specialists. 
There’s also the strategy aspect of DM, where people specialise in overall strategy planning, such as campaigns to run, which media channels to buy, which influencers to engage etc. People here usually end up as strat planners/head of strategy.
Look at threads where people have asked similar questions and find the most comprehensive answers with the most upvotes. 
I used to work for an agency that handled a lot of Facebook advertising, we started to believe that once an ad was banned it increased the likelihood of future ads becoming banned when posted from the same account (we had one account that couldn’t get anything approved). 
We kept contacting FB support every day voicing our frustrations and threatening to pull all of our ads off the site. One day, the original ad was suddenly approved and ran fine. 
Reason might be:   
Change the wording completely to something vaguely relevant but not pitchy. Pause and review, submit for manual review if its refused and then contact facebook directly about it. Once one is approved, I've had the same positive as Brendan that its easier once one is approved.
3 charges
I always use client credit card details for accounts. This means that their cashflow problems are their problem. 
Agree during set up budgeting so they aren't surprised.
I would usually charge around about: 1-2k for setup depending on industry and amount of copy they want written.
Then £300-£600 a month for monitoring.
Budget adjustments are agreed with the client but the management fee remains the same unless extensive extra keyword research is needed.
Always try to charge client with two things in mind.
1. Account and Campaign setup cost (one time)
$500 for account and Campaign setup
Use their ad account for ad spend, tell them to put credit card with $1000 in their ad account
Ask them to bank transfer your retainer, in this case is $500
Yes it is possible.. depends on your capacity to learn and grab.. you can refer some YouTube videos and blogs which focus on blueprint exams.. you can find sample questions on internet if you do little search.. i think the whole course is divided into little modules.. and each module has seperate exam and certificate.. so you can achieve them one by one...
Yes, it is possible but you have to put your time and efforts in Facebook Blueprint. Then you will be able to take the test with 1 or 2 weeks.
SMM would be good to start with, because they also have paid advertising on these platforms that are in high demand. If you learn Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter advertising, you'll be in a good spot beside generally knowing social media strategy. 
SEO Will Take more time to give Result and SMM will give you Result Instant but you have to implement properly Otherwise You will not Get You ROI also So i suggest you first learn everything and go a head and Start With SMM and Make Huge Revenue
There is a lot of difference between SEO and SMM. SEO stands for search engine optimization it helps you to get organic traffic from major search engines. Apart from that SMM stands for social media marketing which is use to get paid traffic from various social media channels. 
Create account on quora like websites and create questions and answers with diff account. Use (best) type keywords. Try this and report me
It takes couple of weeks to couple of months. Basically it depends on your SEO efforts. If you do lots of hard work in building the high authority backlinks, then you can rank your keyword within a few weeks. 
Is it indexed? Since ive ranked for the keyword in 2 days all using on page optimization and no backlinks 
Where are you now that there aren’t any openings? PPC is red hot. Any major city will have it. If you love the idea of NYC then go for it, although you’ll probably have to pay your way there. There are other much cheaper major cities that would work just as well. 
Exact same situation here. Really struggling to find a position doing PPC. I'm in Melbourne, Australia. Applying for 'Marketing Coordinator' jobs as well but haven't got an interview for any, seems like it's tough at the moment.
We just did a massive lead source mapping exercise for our new lightning instance not sure what's the best way to share add me on Linkedin? pm me
Have you tried the Postcards by Designmodo? here are marketing and transactional emails.
Bounce rate benchmarks for online retailers.
Click through rate benchmarks for health care display ads.
Video completion rate benchmarks of pre roll video.
Start in analytics looking day by day at refers? I’d even export the data into a google sheet. Look for the spike

Question: Who is my client, what is my product and how does it differ?
Jobs are about networking and who you know. I made the pivot out of PR and into marketing early in my career too. I got my first job and many jobs after that because of someone I had met earlier in my career. Mete people at brands and companies you wan to work at ... and some you would never think about. You will get out of it what you have put in, in the end if you network with people and make it something you do regularly. 
If you actually know what you're doing in digital marketing you don't work for somebody because you know how to make your own money. Best part about it. 
Gosh I feel like all of us in this field run into this same...mid career crisis?  I’ve been in a similar rut for the last year, but somehow luckily landed something in general digital marketing to move me forward. 
1. Don't spend too much time in studying the course and passing the certification 
2. Find a small business through friends and family and offer free social media  management and basic website optimization
Smaller companies want to know why it’s important and what you do. 
The change I suggest for larger companies is stop talking effort and start talking benefit. 
Outcomes, not inputs. 
- What can you do for me
- Why I need it
- How can I get it (give me something easy to say yes to)
If it isn't the CEO but the Marketing Director at a larger business show and demonstrate the value he can then communicate to his boss (and take the credit).  
Have actual numbers and valid results of how it improved their business. Cool so you improved their page speed/google ranking etc. WTF did that change in terms of customers/revenue/ etc.  
It seems a bit dodgy, but nobody got fired by copying their biggest competitor/doing more than them. They often do for missing out on what those competitors are doing.   
Lastpass is the one I use, I think there are a few others too. 
Bitwarden, it’s like lastpass but free
You could get shot down for a number of reasons - not a personality fit, you’re fine but they just have a better candidate, your salary range is too high, etc. 
Yep, I'm hitting my max capabilities at the moment and it is hard!  
A lot of brand/creative/web/PR agencies outsource paid digital media to other agencies. So they take in the budget from the client but run the media thru their partner who will report to the agency.
We do it all the time. Ranging from smaller digital agencies without the capabilities, medium agencies without the bandwidth, PR/Creative/Web agencies that are out of their depth and want an enterprise solution, etc.
Some ignore it entirely but the ones that don't see it as a value add and a way to increase their retainer/monthly billing and most importantly stay relevant to their clients.
I ran a digital agency for a number of years...
In the beginning, we used to compete on price, and take on as many clients as we could manage and ebb and flow freelancers to handle the excess when we didn't have enough time. 
As we scaled and got more steady clients, we were able to hire a few key people to manage them. Having a handful of well paying steady clients made it a lot easier to say no to shitty clients.
Now our intake form is basically a filter to see if we want to take on a client. 
No more "one and dones", if someone wants that then we charge a healthy premium. 
Now we are priced well above competition. 
Why? Because we spend more time and do more than most agencies who honestly do the bare minimum. I've seen proposals, agreements, etc from competitors, big firms, and its mostly fluff/BS/vague and they still compete on price. So when I get a prospective client who is shopping around and have them break down whats actually done with other firms, we win every time. It helps justify our high pricing and weed our smaller clients who we don't really want anyway.
As such, we only take on bigger clients for longer term. This allows us to scale at a reasonable pace organically, as getting one more big client comfortably allows us to hire additional people to help manage them. Longer term means we can show them scaling results, so they are likely to continue to have us manage them.
Yes, in Italy too :)
One of the best ways to do this is 'lumpy mail'. When I first started I would record a video of me auditing their social media and then put it on a flash drive and mail it to them in a gold padded envelope. 
What does having a lot of followers have to do with being a credible social marketer?
\- A/B test subject lines before going out to all
\- pre header text
\- alt text on images
\- CTA above fold for most common clients and 13inch screen
\- CTA above fold for mobile optimised version
\- make sure your data is clean beforehand, dont use a salutation like "Hello AUSSIEJOSH,"
From my past experience in a B2C company
\- I don't think generic wishes work. Customers are already bombarded with messages on email, and if the event is a major holiday, they will receive numerous such messages around the holiday. 
We run campaigns specific to different festivals like Diwali, New Year, and even Women's Day. We were ourselves surprised to see the response of women's day campaign and the footfall it generated at one of our outlets.
Our learning was to actually trying to find the reason why a particular audience will care about your offer / service during a particular festival season. If we do that right, it works despite the clutter.

These are not really courses but ultimates guides.
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:
Hey! I made an account to respond to this post. My digital marketing agency has worked with multiple non profits (currently working with veterans transitioning) as well as commercial/government facing brands. We would have no problem executing a politically focused influencer marketing campaign. I'd love to speak more about this, please DM me! 
I went the opposite direction, started in agency and then moved in house.
The agency I was at was super small and brutal. In the end it worked out, because it jump started my career, but I don't really see the point of going to one from an in house position. 
Just my experience.
Not a concrete suggestion, but have you looked into Google Data Studios - you should be able to import all Google data + there are connectors for facebook.
Our lowest prices on Easter offers
Google academy for ads
That's already what is happening. It's really easy to spot, especially with clout rappers. There's much cringe, adam22 has called them out literal countless times. Talked about rappers buying views for videos on his channel to boost them as most viewed on his channel or trending. At the end of the day those people would either just not be successful or the ones that made it onto his show later make themselves look bad some way or another.
Are you receiving rough Cost Per Acquisition estimates from these agencies? What platforms are they suggesting you market on?
Estimates of app downloads vs ad spend vary wildly. Truth is its really hard to know before you've tested the waters for your specific niche. Have you found any marketers who have sold to your target audience before?
What's your total monthly budget and proposed platforms?
Most people will want to run search and social without being able to use programmatic display to drive CPA down.
Nah, I ran campaigns for $7/mo memberships and the company did great.
First of all, if they buy a $20 membership, and that membership renews in 30 days, you’ve 2x’d your ROAS in that time. 
How frequently does the membership renew? If you’re selling subscriptions you need to look at average lifetime customer value when looking at your CPA. That’s why people will pay to give out free trials.
Do you know who your target audience is? How much data do you have at hand, so we can understand the possible scope of scaling and optimisation? 
The productive salesperson who you don’t have to guarantee income for or provide leads to is a unicorn and just as real, in my experience. If I have the skills to self generate and close leads for digital marketing, why would I take a commission instead of simply outsourcing the work and keeping a larger piece of the pie?
bumping for more eyes and opinions. 
The company sells individual-level analytics software, so our main target audience are salespeople in Sweden.
In general, podcast advertising is BRANDING. It's long term brand awareness and not anything else. 
You want them to say "If this sounds interesting, visit company.com/podcast to get a free trial/book/meeting/product/whatever"
That headline combined with a CTA straight away ensures that any visitor coming from the podcast knows exactly where they are and that they're in the right spot. 
You want to make it sound as close to a recommendation as possible. 
4. Don't pay for more than 6 months / 1 season at a time
Technically phrase match is less expensive because its not as targeted as exact match. the only reason i can think of that exact match is much cheaper is because maybe fewer people search for the exact match
I actually work for a programmatic shop. Pm me and we can set up a discovery call!
First of all you need to do a through study of what this business is about and what is the market capability of the business digitally.Then you need to explore that market and see at which point you can take advantage.  
If you have to ask without doing a shred of independent research beforehand, I don’t think digital marketing is for you. The whole industry is about research with trial and error.
Research. If you can't find answers on your own, you're in the wrong business. 
Digital Marketing is a vast field and you cant just master all of it you need to figure out first which part of digital marketing you are focusing on. Let me list down some of them below  
I would maybe see what it all includes and then start with one topic. For example there is social media, social media marketing, seo, sem, content marketing and so much more...
How would you rank yourself? by making content about trending topics you will get ranked on google in no time literally now it's up to you how you manage to make content about trending topics
Using linkedin , Search engine Land, Search Engine journal.. It's very useful to you.
They might ask you to show them your personal social media accounts. Make sure to delete every negative post! And they might ask you on how you would improve their social media accounts. My first job out of college was a social media manager. It's a fun job but it does suck the life out of you if you don't have good time management. Good luck!
What is an area you wish to work on?
- he had clearly spent a lot of time looking at our existing channels, understanding their purpose and the content that they promoted
- he demonstrated that he knew that constant testing and learning was crucial
They’ll ask you 1) thoughts on company’s  current social media strategy, what’s good and bad about it and 2) fave social media profiles for each channel. Have examples to back up choices.
It will be basically regarding the social media strategy, social media calendar, KPIs, campaigns, paid ads etc. 
Same for any ad network. With that much spend (annually? monthly?) I’m sure you have direct contact with reps at every ad network. Some reps are better than others, but they all have the same goal: get you to spend more on their network. 
I'm going to take it in a slightly different direction. So feel free to disagree because it's not an optimization but an add-on.
Using long form customer testimonials as ad copy — even though best practices are to have short copy on FB ads I’ve literally had ads with 2 paragraphs of direct testimonials from customers that have gotten 3x higher ROAS than the same creative only shorter copy.
Lol, but for real I have a few because I’ve been spending massive amounts of time learning recently
I did one and a half  unpaid internships then started sending emails to every local marketing agency that I could find in google. I even sent messages to the ones that didn’t have any job postings up. After a month I got a call from a small marketing agency that didn’t have a job opening posted and they hired me right away. I learned a ton there that has helped me land better jobs. 
LinkedIn is your best bet. Have you gotten any feedback as to why maybe those roles didn’t work out for you? Being in the field, I definitely understand that it’s difficult to obtain a role even though they are plentiful...just trying to understand maybe where the feedback can help 
Well if you have the skills for it, even more if you have experience with what you want to do, there really isn't anything between you and a job. 
Two, find clients. You can for example target prospects you ll like to work for. Audit their actions (website, fb page, seo ranking,...), find quick wins and long term improvements, then make them an offer they can t refuse.
Upwork. Build your portfolio and chops at the same time.
You have to know WHICH problem you want to solve first. 
Learn how to solve just one for the moment, get some results and then show prospects your results. 
Now, get started with the account creation on social channels and designing the website (if not already done). Try to keep the website clean, and mobile-friendly, and speedy, plus easy-to-go content that answers the customer side. Also put some opt-ins to generate sleeping leads.
I know it has been a vague answer. I am struggling with my karma. So yeah. :P
Social Media Platforms are the biggest brand creators now a days so i would suggest campaigns over there.  
"the most efficient way to spend my time at this point." 
Draft a statement of work that clearly defines each deliverable, with a payment triggers for each. If not, an easier way would be to define your hourly rate and approximate the hours per deliverable. He may be your friend, but unless he's paying you a salary, set clear expectations. 
 *  Landing pages
 *  Assumptions. These are very important. If there are any dependencies - this is where they go. If you need him to pay his IT person to work with you, or if you need payments to be current so you can pay subcontractors, that he will provide calendar availability for feedback.
 *  Recurring charges. A retainer is a good way to keep a minimum amount of hours available only to them so you do not take on other commitments that would preclude you from servicing their account. Good for both parties.
PM if you want something more formal. I know I'm leaving details out because it's Friday and I'm on my cell!
If this is an ecomm startup, Shopify is a great solution with a fair amount of customizability and a ton of free apps that integrate extremely well with both Google Ads and Paid Social. 
Finally, a bit in the weeds, but MOTION MOTION MOTION for creative. It may seem daunting depending on your skills, but even a basic gif with early quick cuts will outperform a static most of the time and pretty much guarantee a lower CPM.
Look into online work. Ratracerebellion.com is a great place to start. They have had a lot of social media marketer job postings lately. 
Remarketing and retargeting are the same thing. Build your campaign and [add an audience](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/3210317?co=ADWORDS.IsAWNCustomer%3Dtrue&hl=en&oco=0) as a placement in your campaign. Google supports have most answers when it comes to managing accounts.
The strategy of the campaign depends on a lot of factors such as number of products, product type, if you have different brands, prices etc... There is no easy way to say without analyzing your business what is correct.
So your own opinion is correct, do it by product type. There is no issue changing strategies after a couple of months when you get more data and start to see specific patterns.
I am a digital marketer in LA. Recently moved here from Austin. I work with the big film and tv studios and its big business. Its good work.
job opportunity? the COL is too high though and the place is a hellhole of degeneracy. if you value your soul, stay away
A working marketer looking to move. Remotely consulting for a firm at the moment. 
Thanks for the replies, everyone. I need to convince my manager why there’s pros for me to move to our offices in LA. Anything beneficial? 
***Job opportunity****? Although the call is too high it is also good on everything else*

It’s not SEO (search engine optimization) , because SEO refers to organic advertising.
The term coined for paid advertising is SEM - search engine marketing.
SEO is a very difficult thing to master. Begin with PPC ads certification eg google academy for ads.
Check out youtube. There is so much free content today.
Their API Doesn’t allow it I don’t think 
As a digital marketer, you will need to acquire a set of skills and combine them to deliver results.
Udemy is so helpful, as a digital marketer, you are constantly learning and growing. Udemy is how I keep up even as a pro!
The same to me. I am waiting for someone who will giving the best for you and me. Hope that!
I've been seeing great results on my personal stuff. Implemented some basic SEO on my videos and got them to reach views in the 5 figures a couple of times. Does this happen every time? No, but you're in a better position to go viral if you do by using YouTube as a different channel to drive traffic to your website!
If you have a limited budget, then you should start building backlinks on high-authority sites. What do I mean by that? Profile links, web 2.0's, social bookmarks, article submissions, etc. 
Didn’t really impact me too much, nothing I can’t do later on anyway. 
Another reason why we shouldn’t become dependant on any single platform and to diversify.
I didn’t, but I had to listen to my partner bitch bout it 
Just a dip in scale but we're evergreen so it wasn't that devastating. Also the API still works fine 
That was the longest outage I have experienced I believe. So glad it's up and running. Thankfully everyone has been super understanding.
Lol, oddly enough my day was WAY more productive.  
EDIT: Lol, I definitely didn't realize what sub this was at first.
But from facebook mobile app Iam still able to Manage campaigns
Not only facebook but instagram too 🙄
Watching 400 Youtube videos to try to figure out wtf I was doing.
Getting Admin access to all platforms that I will be handling. Going inside of the platforms to learn the current strategies they're using. Study the analytics data to learn where you are acquiring leads and traffic. See what's working, and what isn't. Start putting together a plan on what changes should be made, and why. 
First day was pretty much all admin (paper work, setting up computer, meeting co-workers and learning about the different teams and how they work together). After all that it was training on the systems/platforms used and shadowing colleagues to see what they did and how they did it. 
I probably got my first assignment during my second week and it was replicating a report that from a month prior with updated data. From there things started to build up but first day and week were more geared to admin and training.
Update information from webs which bring the value to apply for my work \^\^ 
Count me in
I know exactly how you feel I was in the same boat, do you have any digital marketing meetups near you? 
I would say shoot for a cost you know is profitable. If you know you make money acquiring a customer for $75 then shoot for that.
Lifetime Value is a great metric, but something you should never guess at. I've seen folks lose substantial amounts of money because they fundamentally misunderstood the value of their customers.
I don’t think you should be spending $300 per signup yet, but on the flip side, if your paying customers are churning in less than 3 months I would solve that problem before pouring more gas on the fire.
Take your current CPO and set a goal CPO. Calculate the CPO on a Top Level and also on your different channels (adwords, facebook and others). Whilst optimizing your ads keep an eye on your CPO. We track this on a daily basis, especially if we have changes in running ads. If we see an upward trend we need to re-optimize. The longer your ads run the better they become and the algorithms can learn.  
Don't run in the dark, use the date you have.
Yoast is essential, many others vary but I like WP Fastest Cache and Redirection as well. There are so many plugins, but be careful on some as they can cause your site to slow down, affecting SEO. Usually it's those that have javascript to load
Variety of WordPress plugins are available in the market. Everything has its plugin has its own role. 
WordPress SEO by Yoast, SFDC Lead Generation, Broken Link Checker, Google XML Sitemaps many more.
Flip this example on to health care, there are tons of subs that are specific to health conditions and communities to help people connect with others to better live with their condition. People don’t as openly talk about their health on other social media, especially not long form. 
Lol I could go on. I work with tech that uses reddit data and I think it’s super super valuable and a super rich data set , it’s just about how you frame your query and what you’re hoping to answer. 
It doesn’t have to be more valuable; most sites use data aggregators anyway so reddit will have access to much of the same data as google/Facebook.  It’s just a different option and when prices appropriately it works.
Reddit users are the least valued social users 
Reddit users are quite different than other social media players. 
Yes it’s dead. Move on.
If you hate public accounting, don’t get into marketing. 
I heard about this first time in 2010 that "SEO is dying". At that time I was new in this field and bit worried after reading such articles. After almost 10 years, based upon my experience I can firmly say that SEO will never die but keep evolving. Search keep growing with the passage of time and so is the Optimization process.
It won't die but it can be outsourced, automated, or nothing at all. NO ONE KNOWS... The algorithm is constantly changing so anyone says anything definitive about SEO is completely full of it... IMO
There is usually a self-certification button that appears after this so you basically take all responsibility
I work for a national referral brokerage, we do a massive amount of SEO and SEM marketing.  I've also worked in Real Estate for most of the past decade.  Let me know what questions you have and I'm happy to help.
Agree with previous comment. Also the precise wording is a thing. For instance, here in the netherlands, you cannot use things like 'need a mortage?' 
Due to (fair) lawsuits over the last 4 yrs by orgs like the Natl Fair Housing Alliance, Facebook has cracked down on real-estate related ads. Like @bryanpool51 said, they want to prevent redlining & preferential lending. 
i just got hired by a construction company that builds houses to do all their digital marketing. I wonder how this will affect the campaigns...
You can use Tag Manager to set up certain events (clicks on certain elements, filling and sending forms, etc) and push those into analytics, then make a conversion out of an event and import that into adwords. That's the gist of it. I personally really like tag manager and spending a few days to really get the tool has helped the agency a lot, since you're a lot more flexible in your event tracking and don't need to call up the programmers for every little thing.
On campaign level under settings check what are the languages that are being targeted
I turn off mobile completely.
Google doesn't let you filter out mobile apps any more (they changed that a few months ago).
So much fraud on the mobile apps, apps just built for click fraud. Even worse, they'll fake convert just so they can get more ads to click fraud.
Yes, because of some mobile apps Google is struggling with clickfraud on its display network.
If you are purely just now diving into digital marketing with almost no experience, I would encourage you to try free courses to get comfortable with all things marketing to start talking the language by the time April hits.
>Bonus; whats it like starting fresh with Digital Marketing and how can I work to the best of my abilities whilst being unqualified and completely new to it all?
just do it.  watch 400 youtube video...pick a niche and sell...
Start working on getting AdWords certification. You’ll learn all the basic digital marketing concepts and if you show up to work on day 1 already certified your boss should be impressed. Not that certification is the be all end all but it’s a good way to learn the UI inside out. 
Ok so there's 2 ways here:
2. You do it in their account (the client gives you access to their business manager as an advertiser). In this case their account should already be connected to their bank account or credit card so you won't have to spend your own money on ads. The setback here is that after you've done the heavy lifting of campaign setup and are now getting results the client can cut ties with you and keeps the campaigns in their account, so you lose leverage there;
Basic knowledge of how web development works will allow you to properly manage web designers and developers to create sites that sell.
Depend upon your qualification, knowledge. If you have degree you can find job easily. But if you want to do without degree than u have to put some efforts and work hard practically.
No, if you're a fast learner and ready to process and employ tons of information of any kind. In my company, there are two digital marketing guys without a degree and they are doing really well, always full of uncommon ideas. But they had to work very hard to make their way at the beginning of the career. 
Yes it helps but if when we stuck into some step, there is no to tell us how to solve it, than we need an trainer. You can also download all courses file from torrent, if u want to get free course like udemy
Search what? Find out they’re metrics? Or targeting strategy? Or just find the creative used? 
Unmetric will allow you to examine dark posts from a competitor set. But as of a few months ago I think it was just twitter. I think they're trying to add other platforms like fb and insta
What's your current role and goal?
Broadly? Omni channel is the future. There are a half dozen major channels that could draw your attention: Email, Search, Social, Display, Video and Native that could draw your attention and dozens of tactics and campaign types within each of those. 
As a marketer, I would suggest you dabble at all of them but specialize in only one. Because it is hardly realistic to become an expert in all of them. And also micro is the new thing. 
It depends on the role and level of activity / time required etc.
Each channel is unique and has many different aspects. The channels are constantly changing and evolving. There are new channels coming up every few months. So it's physically impossible to stay on top of every channel and become an expert. 
Having said that, you should try to become really good at more than one channel. I am recommending this for two reasons 
* It makes you more valuable and less likely to become obsolete if the channel goes down in popularity 
Let me illustrate with an example. Think about someone who focused only on Twitter 3 years ago when it was near its peak. If that person did not become really good at other social media like Insta or FB, he will be out of demand today as Twitter has become less attractive to businesses. 
It’s better to know something about every channel than to only ever work within one channel. That’s called being siloed and it’s the best way to never advance. Being curious and willing to get outside your comfort zone is so important. You don’t have to know every detail about every channel but general familiarity is goood. 
I got into digital marketing via politics. I knew a few platforms really well and when I launched my own business, I set out to learn "all of them." Quickly realized I was never going to be passionate about some (aka Pinterest) and while I try to have a general overarching understanding of the different platforms, I decided to focus in and be great at a few things, rather than okay at a lot of things. So far, it's been the right strategy for me.
it depends. if you are working in a small sized company, you need to have knowledge about all these different platforms. but in a big sized companies, usually each of these platforms are run by one or more digital marketing experts, experts specialized in that platform. So, first decide where you want to work and then make your knowledge general or special.
I have next to no knowledge about digital marketing, but I would say it's good to know a bit of each, and really focus on one and make it your specialty and area of expertise.
Display banners
Dynamic feed based display 
Non curated Subscriber lists 
Multi layered targeting emails-- national lists 
Let me know if you need help with any of these. We run them all and more. Often for smaller agencies who need help on any of the above or have the margin to outsource. 
Keep in mind that 90% of such courses are nothing but regurgitated basics from the original sources. True experts also do offer paid courses which usually cost much more but contain useful well-structured tips and a lot of practice. I suggest completing courses by Google first and then keeping an eye on real pros (not random $50 courses) who share info for free. Before paying for any course conduct a research (ask people for real reviews, ) and take another month to decide.
Forget udemy - pay proper money for a proper course from someone who is currently doing it well (i.e Cat Howell, Tim Burd...)
A job doing grunt work for a mentor.
From what ive studied, even though dropshipping is not as sustainable in the long run, if you get a successful campaign going with the right product, you can keep running retargeting ads, sit back, and let the money flow in for months until you have to find a new product. 
Turn on campaigns, get conversions and revenue. Continue until you have enough data to build LAL and grow your business. 
As for some suggestions, Yes, a lot comes down to data, but a strategist looks at logic, which is rhetorical math. I've been doing this for 4 years, and I graduated with a degree in philosophy. It helps break down the abstract/concrete and how they support each other, and how they differ. Everyone learns /what to think/ with a marketing degree.  You already know a lot of that, and if you don't go take FB Blueprint or whatever course. But in the real world, you need to learn /how to think/. You have good experience. But to me the time spent doing something is irrelevant (in most cases). 2 months managing 250k in ad spend for me may be more than 6 month of someone managing 25k. So stress the importance of the work you did.  This is all my opinion. I can't tell you anyone is right or wrong. I just know what works for me! Keep up the good work
PS I don’t work in the corporate world so I can’t speak for that, I run my own business, but that’s what I’d hire when it comes to hiring a digital marketing strategist
I run marketing for a pizza catering company and our best marketing efforts have been 1. SEO 2. Google Ads 3. Social retargeting. In that order. 
Step one identify the client's pain points and business goals. 
Two, if required build the client a proper way to track marketing efforts (pixels installed, track conversions into a CRM, ensure the POS allows for taking voucher codes etc). 
Social converts suck.
Foster reviews.
Marketing is mostly about having operational excellence and retention of acquired business. 
Listen to the customers not social chatter. 
It’s 2019 after Fred Algorithm open your wallet for traffic or do it the honest way by being excellent.
Source/medium is important (make sure all traffic is UTM tagged!)
Gather data about the audience- where they came from, what they did, and their characteristics. 
CXL has s great course on GA, pricey though . 
Learn data studio!
Definitely get the certs, they're easy and (in my opinion) more valuable to a potential employer at this level than a marketing degree. 
I cut my teeth being a co-ordinator. It's a good entry level role. You can go for big agencies where it will be more gruelling and competitive but possibly teach you at a higher level, or you can go for small agencies and learn how to do lots of different types of marketing at once.
Make sure you’re not losing sight of what it is you want to convey (or better yet- what they are looking for): you’re a strong presenter, your thoughts and content are organized and appealing, you have a basic knowledge of the practices your team will be executing, you can think creatively about where to find opportunities for your client and communicate them clearly. You know the process.
You could make up a specific fake client here, I’m thinking. Or one very clearly based on one of their current clients if they have one that matches the criteria. Then you can get really specific about audiences and opportunities without the risk of being too generalized and failing to show your skills for strategy.
Have a variety of ads to test. Link google analytics to Adsense 
\-Now Google allow 5 different sized ads per page :) - Increase ads boxes= increase pages views =increase Clicks
Do you think your company would let you work remotely? I had a friend in advertising in a similar situation. She asked her job if she could move to a different state and work remotely, and they agreed. Doesn’t hurt to ask. 
Politics is a very controversial topic. I try to avoid them because it may deter other clients away who support opposing parties etc. Depends on where you live but in the country where I live no matter how much it pays I stay out of it.
I did a good one. Created a website like a form where you choose differents options and at the end I told you which one you should vote. It got viral 
Digital marketing for a political figure isn't really that far from digital marketing for your products. I mean, its like selling, but now your advertising for someone. So the basics still apply. 
I have helped a handful of candidates with digital marketing (website, social media, content strategy/automation, advertising, and video townhall with streaming). There are plenty of things that are similar, like u/smiley44 says but there are unique challenges. Candidates were harder to manage (scripts/talking points, etc.) than brands and the level of interaction is AMAZING with both supporters and random public who want to troll/fight/disparage/derail your communications.
Only two of these candidates spent money on polling but honestly the audience metrics were just as predictable. I like the pacing but the politics of it were a struggle. 
Just my $0.02.
One of the good tool for political figure must use it by using every platform to engage with public 
Follow the basic rules of Brand Marketing and treat the person as brand while doing marketing. It will help you to perform better. For example, I did some for myself in 2017 and yet the results are still there. If you open google and type Ravi Kumar Rana then you can find almost all of my profile link on first page of google and my blog which I recently set up in October, is ranking on 1st position. 
The only way to get that info, to my knowledge is to sign up for their newsletter and watch what comes in. It’s not a terrible business idea to set up automation to do this, but most businesses probably aren’t smart enough to look for a service like that or understand the value, so your top line would probably be very limited.
I'd say nothing beats hands-on experience.
Nope. Never do the page thing. It messes with your custom audience and organic reach.
Start by building a website and then bringing users onto it and then growing it.
I can give you specific pointers, but honestly, the best way to learn would be to get started, stumble on a problem, find a solution, and then carry on.
I work at a digital agency so I hire people for all kinds of roles all the time and 100% of them are self-taught. 
Where you start sort of depends on what you want to do. If you want to be a developer, start a website. Wordpress is a good place to start -- not too basic but not too challenging either. There are lots of decent free resources for learning to code, like CodeAcademy, etc.
No matter what I'd recommend starting getting into Google Analytics. There's a certificate but I'd probably start with blogs and resources before the cert program.
Start with learning the different verticals of Digital Marketing- email marketing, social media marketing, paid search, and so on.
As "anotherbozo" said, start with a website. The website need not be perfect. Use it to experiment digital marketing tactics.
Do you have the traffic to A/B test different texts and button colors?
Pick a winner, make that the A leg of another A/B test.
[edit: read more] try “take my money!” Too!!! It doesn’t hurt, you just don’t want to test too many splits at a time if you have low total traffic because it will take forever to reach significance.
Why not look at what other major SaaS brands do? We have worked on tons of SaaS brands and they all use something different. A/B test what some of the best do with their signup flow.
I've had success with things like "get my tickets" and " give me my X" type language that emphasizes what they are getting by paying. But the only answer is throw a bunch of options out there and test them all.
Pay and [future action related to the service/product]. For example if the service is a designing tool it could read Pay and Start Designing. This is completely hypothetical, but I believe that reminding the customer about the service/product they are getting in the same caption might help to reduce or cancel any doubt/pain experienced just before clicking 
What company and what certifications do you have? I'm also from the NW Chicago suburbs looking to break into this field
Glassdoor says that the salary range for this posituon in Chicago is $41-$91k with a $61k average.
It's hard to make salary requests without substantial hands-on experience nonetheless I would ask for a 3 month performance review and that should give you leverage depending on your work ethic  and level of commitment. Put yourself in the employers shoes and think of something reasonable. Also remember that they're paying you  to train you whether it's directly or indirectly and those skills will carry over to the next company or your own projects or both.
Either that, or just say you’d like $500k, drop the mic and stare at them until they respond :)
When i was working at an agency i used mailchimp too and my first tests were going to the junk too.
2. The subject line
just try to play with those and see how the tests are being handled.
First, let me address some of the most common reasons why an email could land in the un-friendly zone, aka, spam.
If your IP Address was used for spam in the past, this could choke your current email metrics as well.
Mailbox providers weigh in this aspect as well during their spam filtering process.
Try not sending emails to dormant email accounts- emails that have not been active for a long time.
Don’t promise the stars in your subject line. Be genuine!
I’d still recommend not to send Bulk emails. Batch and Blast is a bad idea.
Try segmenting your email lists to make it smaller, and cleaner.
Another such tool is called e-Campaign. It  is a full featured mass Email tool.
Hope that helps!
Thrid.. 100/150 bounces means you obviously bought some shitty list that was old or scraped. Stop that. This is a business so treat it that way. Either start building your own list or buy a quality list from a reputable seller.
Spam on what provider? Gmail will inevitably end up in promotions. Either way, don’t worry. People check “spam” regardless of it being a filter just to make sure they didn’t miss anything. If it’s worthwhile, they will see it. 
In the end we are all fucked :)
No, it’s not the end. Because business owners (b2c) want to run their business. That’s why they hire agencies to handle all digital 
Tell me if you know a client that will allow Google Ads to run their whole campaign and I'll leave this industry right now 
The cost of an employee to manage AdWords to the same level that an agency would, I believe would be more expensive. 
I’m high up in the digital marketing world, yet we still outsource our Google AdWords for our business for convenience. There is better areas I and the rest of my team could spend our time on 
There may be a small shift, but in the overall spectrum I do not think this will be a massive impact to digital marketing agencies bottom line 
Yes, agency margins on media will definitely continue to shrink.  However, there is still a serious need for many other digital marketing channels 
Moz has no control over your website. It's simply a 3rd party tracker that tries to guess, as best as it can, how Google views your site.  
Don't stress. They've (for the most part) just re-optimized so link manipulators don't have as high a score. As a result, DA seems to have dipped somewhat across the board. They go into this in depth on their blog, and cover the average DA dips for different categories of websites. The only way this truly affects anyone is that if they:
No you don't need to take it too serious. But remember that before MOZ 2.0 release, Moz was showing the high DA even of low quality sites. But with MOZ 2.0 it is providing the low DA of low authority sites and high DA of high authority sites.
Yep, noticed the same thing. Could get the dashboard insights for the past day and week, but nothing for the past 28 days. I ended up looking at the specific metrics for insight instead. Frustrating.
All the time, at least twice per week. It eventually shows up, but is super frustrating in the meantime. 
Probably a waste of money. Talk yourself into an entry level role at an agency and work your way up from there.
I honestly never attended or joined one. I did not go to college for marketing, but now am the head of marketing for a software company. I think if I wanted to get into marketing now, I would do the following (which some you have done):
Everything I learned was on my own and through working at a marketing agency to learn more. But if I was starting now, I'd probably do what I mentioned above.
Save your money and do the free certifications and courses offered by Google and HubSpot. Moz has free courses and so does Hootsuite. If you really want to pay for a course, search Udemy or Udacity for cheap courses (they usually have regular sales where the classes are around $10).
But everything you need to know to get started in digital marketing you can teach yourself. This is exactly the tactics I used to land my first digital marketing job.

What you want to do in Social media management? 
I would like to do basic tasks. Manage and schedule posts, content.  Nothing crazy, just a tool to provide clients. 
"Starboard Quarterly" - it's a play on Starboard Quarter which is the right rear section of a boat. Of course, this would only work if it's a quarterly newsletter.
7. What is the current download rate of special publications, eBooks etc. created by the organization?
I'd love to hear what others suggest :)
Feel free to DM me if you have any questions.
What's the website, that would help with feedback. 
>capabilities to get a quick high high level look at competitor metrics like followers, engagement rates, type of content, etc. 
And yes, I would really recommend checking out the social media workflows at the Easy Solutions page, as u/vendetta4guitar has suggested. ;)
I'm on the same boat. Im trying to get my competitor facebook page insight but cant find a tool. For example, i want to find their target audience.
Ahrefs  is the best tool for competitor analysis...
Similarweb  - it varies in accuracy though but you get a basic picture
We had a client move to GDN from other activity for cheaper clicks but we saw much higher bounce rates from it so its cheap but its not good.
A couple of tips 1) try a whitelisting sites, especially at small budgets get really focused on targeting options which make sense for what you know about your customers. Start super tight, use as many targeting options as you think you could apply, otherwise the system will waste budget on cheap but ineffective clicks. 
2) increase your bids - you get what you pay for and to get some scale when it's tightly targeted. 
This is a bit facetious, so apologies, but I’d say it’s a good thing. Turn them off and out some proper tracking in place instead / smart goals are pretty much useless 99% of the time. 
If you want me to take a look at your site and suggest a goal setup feel free to reply here or DM me 👍🏼 
Edit: no charge / sales follow up - just happy to help. 
Why would you even want to use smart goals? Just use custom goals specific to your company or client's goals.
I mean. Wow.
I've never done bulk WhatsApp but I imagine if you did it would go straight into the blocked section.
If you're in the EU, this is a GDPR nightmare just waiting for you to press send.
This seems like setup for disaster. 
I understand what you're trying to do, and trust me, WhatsApp may sound effective but it won't be a right channel in long run. 
We have tried executing something similar at our startup (B2B) but it wasn't worth.
I'm not sure about the tool you're using, but the number would definitely be blocked
I have dropped that idea 
Why are you chasing Likes? What does that have to do with your business objectives?
The best and the cost effective way is to run an add campaign on Facebook with low budget. You will get >50 likes within a week. 
If your sites have Good Analytics...you can setup alerts for when traffic drops as one way to monitor things.
I use UptimeRobot on the web. Has a free and paid version.
ManageWP is dirt cheap for all it does. Highly highly recommend. Non intrusive, no headaches, just runs in the background and you don’t have to worry about it (until you need it). 
I wouldn't often recommend this but just go outright buy some email/mailing lists (like several, from different companies). This will be super cheap compared to most other means of acquisition.
Honestly you could try direct mail to the churches. Design it well, don’t make it look like junk mail, and provide a real incentive for them to visit the site on the postcard. 
Maybe even some of those really convincing, but not actually handwritten, handwritten notes. 
you want to spend a half a million dollars to acquire identities of pastors? okay message me i'll help figure it out
edit: emails, custom audiences and ads, friend/like requests
Although, this is grunt work it has many advantages. 
- information we collect is publicly available 
- connection is less shady since there's a contact made with the lead organizations 
Finally, there is benchmarking, where a brand could use listening data to compare their engagement and/or brand perception against their competitors.
Broadly speaking, monitoring is intended to provide you with items to act on. Comments on your FB posts, posts using your branded hashtags, people speaking negatively about your brand on Twitter, etc.
Listening is more of a research activity, where you try to gather additional consumer data on a certain topic that feeds back into your marketing or R&D department, but is not directly actionable. I.e. if I’m in the umbrella business and I want to gather knowledge about people’s behavior and attitudes around rain, I would listen on social around that subject and gather data that my engineers can use to make a better umbrella - but I wouldn’t reply to each person talking about rain trying to sell them my umbrella.
I think both are same because these are the ways to analysis and prepare the social marketing strategy. From my point of view social monitoring and social listening tools  are different.
Even "happy to help you " seems a bit better to me.
have you used mailing lists in the past? 
What is your subject line? 
Do this, forget about the bid amount set it to maximize clicks don't set any bid amount, at least run it 2 days after that pause the ad and review your ad with search terms, after this you can find out what's your negative keywords and best keywords that you can get maximum clicks  then adjust the bid amount with respective of that.
I also asked this question on the Google Ads user forum and someone there suggested that my $10/day budget is too small.  Thoughts on that?  What do you think is the minimum daily budget to be competitive enough to get your ads seen?
I really need to either solve this or know for sure if I should drop it and move my March campaign back to Facebook.  (I know they're not the same kinds of advertising platforms.  I hoped to do both, actually.)
I also prefer using daily budgets rather than lifetime budgets - makes it easier to scale, should you want to.
Definitely implement the strategy basicbatch suggested, you want to re-target those who showed interest but did not convert initially. 
Intercom does everything you’ve listed and more.  Tidio does a majority of your list for free. Best of luck, this is a tough space.
There are already a few out there.
The concepts are correct but the assumptions on CTR and CR values may not be. It depends on which digital channel we're talking about, the type of campaign, country, etc. For instance 2% CTR is too high if we're thinking only of display banners.
This is incredible insight. Motivates me to get on client delivery. My hesitation to approach client always there but this article now motivates me to get on to approach new clients.
Could you please tell me how much experience required. I have 3 years of experience in AdWords and 2 years of experience in SEO and Social media marketing. 
I am doing lots of web design work and video production work for clients. 
I want to start moving into Facebook ads with my clients. 
The bit that trips me up is the ad spend. 
Obviously if I pay Facebook for the client I am able to change the amount spent on creating the content and the amount spent on the ads per month. Eg 1000 a month spend could be 500 on content 500 given to Facebook one month but month 2 I would give more to Facebook and less on content if I was reusing the ads. 
Thanks for any help.  
You can get pretty much anything with a valid credit card just do all your research before the free trial expires or get a refund within 30 days - if you need more than 30 days to get all your research done you're not doing it right.
Any free backlink analysis tool that you guys know of. A tool that atleast shows all the linking domains for free.

Any Trello tips and tricks? I’ve used it off and on but it never stuck - my current workflow process is wearing on me so I’ve been thinking of trying Trello again (especially after your post).
Excellent post, I´ve tried most of this platforms and had amazing results but them being compiled here is amazing.

Congratulations man. I'm having trouble finding a digital marketing internship, I can't imagine how hard it is to find a job.
Keep learning. Never stop learning. Marketing is ever changing and there is no such a thing as staying at the same knowledge level. If you are not going ahead, you are losing ground.
Well man, good luck. I just got recently hired too as an SEO analyst. My pay is $35,000 but I live in an area with low expenses. Also, my concern was more about just getting into the industry. That and I'm working with one of the best experts in the field. 45,000 in New Jersey might be a bit difficult to live on tho. I was interviewing with a company in New Jersey a few months back for a PPC position and I was in the final stage. If I had gotten hired, I would have had a $53,000 salary.
I would personally ask the hiring manager about the living expenses of New Jersey, then ask him what he thinks is acceptable for the low and high range of the job's salary taking those expenses into account. He could end up raising your salary as a result. You never know.
Also keep in mind that there are two reasons they hired you. Reason one is because they thought you were the best fit of course. But reason number two is because they can't find anyone with your talent in the state. 
Recent marketing grad here so sorry if this is a taboo question, but is 45k a common rate for a specialist position in NJ? That’s more or less my base rate going into coordinator positions out in WA. 
Nice work and congrats! Learn as much as you can, ask to learn what others are working on. Super beneficial as you want to move up the ranks in marketing. 
Also Neil Patel is good but just for very basic stuff. 
I got hired as a Digital Marketing “assistant”, which was basically my mentor. 
Now I’m a marketing manager for a billion dollar a year ecommerce company, with a huge career ahead of me.
Digital Marketing has become one of the most exciting, challenging and fast-paced industry and it covers a wide and diverse range of areas of knowledge including 
A channel I found yesterday which seems useful is "Surfside PPC"
Look back after 3 months of reading all this blogs and listening and watching these guys. You will have knowledge that you never thought you can have.
Don't forget, knowledge is the most powerful tool, if you know how you can apply it in the action.

Seth Hymes digital marketing career blueprint
I got a part time job in less than a month and a full time one after 3 months
**I think this is why agency experience is valuable.** 
I took my first job at a small agency in the twin cities a few months after graduating from college. We had some seasoned 10-15 year internet marketing vets who have managed to stay pretty sharp and on top of new tools/tactics etc. They were doing mostly selling at this point, but still would help on big accounts.
I came in having never truly worked with the back-end of a website. I had hardly worked with any sort of analytics or reporting tools. Having experienced people to bounce ideas and questions off was essential for me. And seeing in to a variety of businesses can give you all sorts of ideas for things that might work for new clients.
There are so many bullshitters and scammers out there. It’s been like that for years. I remember when Açaí berry supplements and affiliate marketing were a thing. Then I leaned how legit agencies get it done and never looked back.  That drop shipping crap is a totally different hustle from what we do. 
The best thing about working in-house is that you have an actual product that the right audience wants. Also everyone is focusing on traffic but no one is talking about setting up the right sales funnels. That’s the other great thing about working in-house—it’s about sales and everything you do should have an ROI. Don’t get distracted by the billions of different ways to use digital marketing and just keep your focus on knowing exactly who your customer is.
I totally agree. I always ask myself why aren't they just working instead of telling others how to work. I love working for a small business, learning about their work and trying to help them grow. If I really knew how to get rich I would try to make it myself.
> No one is talking about marketing for mom and pop stores, brick and mortar businesses, service based companies, etc. 
Because a lot of these cats don't want to pay the budgets we need but I think you are right, I am also tired of this trend but seems like it is where the money is
I was thinking today something similar. We are so much surrounded by the “marketing for marketers” that it is hard to find stuff beyond “the box” which is very limiting
As a new marketer I've definitely been disappointed by all the shovel selling going on, not just because so many focus on ONLY selling shovels, but because much of the time the shovels themselves are poorly manufactured so to make you keep coming back for another and another and...
I know exactly what you mean, it’s the whole “I’ll show you how to make money by showing you how to sell things to other people”.
Marketing has become so cheap and tacky, I always want to bring meaningful strategy and good ideas back to the art.
Shoutout to the freelancers out there working towards something big.
In the middle of changing my prices and services- this was helpful, thanks!
There’s tons of reports you could find that show digital media spend as a percentage of all media spend for companies. One step further would be showing them how competitors in your industry spend if you have access to tools like that. 
Search, display and advanced programmatic isn't even on his radar?
Do you use SFDC or anything like that? If so I’ve found that showing how a marketing automation system can work as an inside sales manager might work. C-level people’s ears perk up when you’re talking directly about sales. 
The social media mavens who came out of the woodwork 10 years ago ruined a lot for people in digital marketing. 
Also, if possible just do things without asking for permission. A few small tests that won't use up too much budget. Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.
Ask him to let you test a budget. 
Show him case studies. I have car dealerships where I drive traffic into their door. Therefore, when I call on other car dealerships to earn business I present them with case studies. 
I would strongly suggest you tell him your product and where its target audience are. I'm sure they are not only on social media. 
It’s almost 2019. If they legit still think that in this day and age, turn around, walk away, find another job.
I'd only try to convince him of one thing at a time.  Otherwise older people tend to shut down when it comes to new tech (not all older people but in my experience its been the 80/20 rule min).
But you can honestly look around a client's office and point out no less than 5 screens. 
Have a meeting and ask everyone in the room to show what they would do when they want to buy the product. No one will go to social. 
With that, have a supporting presentation, calling out that you knew what they’d do (google) and show the marketing funnel, from awareness to conversion. 
You’ll prove they’re missing a big area.
As mentioned, money also talks, so backing up with ROI by channel will help. 
When recently proving we didn’t need a transactional app (retail company) I got everyone to look at their screen time/battery usage - realising it was all social - the app idea was quickly parked. 
Love this idea!
I have only 39 karma here so not to strong account I have yet. Give me advise about how we do this.
I am happy to help.
Hey! Guess what! I have made a subreddit moviemarketing. We choose a movie and watch its marketing stuffs. The channels how they communicate and everything we want.  There we can talk about everything without disturbing the others.
I can't do interviews, my brain simply shuts down and I start mumbling weird sh** :-/
Once when I have been asked why I applied for a job I said that I did it for fun...which wasn't entirely untrue thou....
25% answered yes conveys the same meaning as 75% answered no but makes the whole thing easier to read.
What country is this in? It's hard to believe only 25% prefer a one-page CV... My colleagues and I discard resumes that come in more than 1 page. 
I'm currently trying to land a job as a digital marketer but mannnnn it's so hard ! Thank you a lot !
if you are agency, you should know to follow the ad platforms for news and what is going on.
You can visit Moz, semrush, search engine land to get digital marketing facts, tips and updates. 
I found your post taking me back to a time where I felt the most like a strategic marketing manager. 
The grass isn't always greener and as I have moved into larger organisation over the last 10 years, yes there are more people to bounce ideas off and teams to develop, however there are very few skilled people like you able and very capable.
When that job role has long gone believe me you'll have learned so much more than many others in the digital feild than you can realise right now. Teams come with there own challanges/ problems and distractions.
You are not alone you are the pioneer and make sure the people you work for recognise that and value your diverse skills. Team can wait trust me.
Feel free to msg me any time with questions I'll help if I can.
Be excellent.
Yeah I was a “one man show” and it was a lot of work. To be honest though it felt great because my role was crucial for the company (I don’t think they knew this sometimes because none of them knew what seo was for example). I was getting experience in everything and then realizing how underpaid I was, so I took a new job in a different city. More pay and less work. Now I work with a graphic designer, social media specialist and others. Now I don’t feel as important even though I know how to do their jobs (except our graphic designer, he does some insane work). But the team finds me very resourceful because I can do all there work (in case someone goes on vacay or is swamped). So I may not feel as important in my new job but I love the more laid back atmosphere, while getting paid double and learning from others.
Point is whether you’re a lone-wolf marketer or with a team, they both have there own pros and cons. 
I've been there too. Totally open to a slack group, dischord, whatever. Some things that helped me stay productive:
Some things that helped me stay inspired:
I'm not completely solo but I do SEO/SEM-PPC/email/website design/dev/analytics and tracking so I feel you. One thing I started doing is taking tedious low priority tasks and outsourcing it through fiverr and Upwork on company budget of course. Honestly though I like it like this, I feel I can provide good value and it would be hard to replace me cause I have my hands tied with so many things. Best of all this is a really good accelerated learning experience.
Down for a slack group! Semi alone, it's me and a and a very junior employee working on 3-4 clients
I'm too the "one man show" in marketing for a robotcell company I work for, and can relate to the struggles of feeling lonely. 
Yeah it can be frustrating but it’s even worse when you go somewhere bigger and have to wait for days on people to do stuff you can do in 15 minutes.
Up until this year, I was always flying solo (the marketing anyway).
Then I was the VP Marketing of a startup with no one else on my team but me:) I did it all and to be honest, but I wasn't able to do my best because when you do everything you have little time to learn new things. At least I did. I ended up feeling stuck professionally.  
Then I did the same thing for a different company but there I had to outsource the paid media and graphic design because I just couldn't handle it all. It wasn't the best thing for the business for me to do it all.
There are pros and cons to being a lonely marketing wolf but bottom line I think it can only work while the business is small.
Anyway, count me in for that slack group.
Interested! Please keep me posted with the chat group. 
Depends on what you want to do in digital marketing. A Marketing degree offers the most opportunity on the marketing/advertising/ecom side while Info Sys sets you up for analytics and data science. A Digital Marketing degree is a waste of money as most programs are at least 5 years behind what we are actually doing in the field.
My university actually offers a digital marketing bachelors degree. The classes have been so cool and actually teach me skills to use at work. Maybe try searching for schools with degrees like that?
A lot of digital marketing is learned on the job and a degree is only there to set foundations for further growth. Choose whatever interests you and go from there. A degree won't trap you into a specific career path in this industry - experience and tangible results matter more.
Yes exactly, Google Analytics is my favorite too 👌
I have a Philosophy BA and a strategy MBA. When i finished the masters I started working in digital marketing making MySpace pages a d selling banner clicks for $0.10. 
I do it that way to.
Highest value activity is staying current on reading.
2nd highest value activity is writing  and posting it where ever there is an audience.
Solo marketer here. Most of my time is spent on email. We send *too freaking many* a week, and I’m in charge of the writing the copy for all of them.  Besides that, I spend time doing audience engagement, partnership outreach, and metrics. 
Here is a typical day for me 
4) build more email campaigns ( we do 8 big events a year so we always have rolling events)
5) check in with production and make sure she is on task with her materials 
6) look at analytics for past trends 
7) update all production documents I have created to keep my team on track ( I have a timeline for anything and everything )
8) check in with event manager on anything she needs me to promote to custom groups 
9) update my project management software 
This is a slow day for me usually it’s about double the size of the list ... it’s fun but crazy ! 
Yup... and for an agency, meaning that loneliness you feel is, for me, multiplied by however many clients we have at any one time. I hate to say it but I spend most of my time explaining the absolute basics of what I do (the top of the ice burg) to clients and people I work with to make sure they see the value. As for actual hands-on work (the part of the ice burg you can't see), I spend as much time as possible creating efficiencies in my workflow, streamlining processes, automating things to save time, and researching ways to do so. I constantly feel like I'm robbing Peter to pay Paul but any time saved in one area is time I can spend elsewhere. The sad truth is if you can't explain/prove your value to whoever pays you (employer or clients) it doesn't matter what you spend your time on if you are the most experienced in your work, even if the levers you pull on a daily basis are making a huge difference... which they most likely are. Obviously, it varies person-to-person depending on your strengths/weaknesses, business-to-business depending on biz objectives, budgets, etc. but always make sure they know the value of your work. You can do 10 things poorly or a couple of things well and there are only so many clicks of the mouse you can make in any one day, pick the ones with the largest impact and sell the SH!T out of it.
solo digital marketer for a small company here. i'd say my time is divided pretty evenly between content creation (blog posts, infographics, email content), backlink outreach, SEO, website design and updates, and analytics.
analytics is also important so you know what is working and what needs tweaking.
We are a tiny startup and everybody is doing marketing here. I'm a developer but I mostly write content and engage with fellow developers. It was a big change for me but I was told about it before I joined so it wasn't a surprise.
Yes, I am a solo Marketer for my company. I have divided my time and concentrating first on the Channel which is most potential.  
Seriously I was in the same boat. I follow a Quant based marketing that a mint has followed. I have created my own plan and working on. It makes my life easy and getting some good result.
1. Identify all the marketing channels
2. Focus on the channels where is your target audience 
4. Run the campaign on every channel for one week.
Yup, I'm the head of marketing for a software company. I'm also the only marketer, so I do it all. 
I tend to knock out small mundane tasks right in the am, and focus on  items that move the needle most. It comes down to prioritizing what has the greatest immediate and long-term impact. 
I'm the solo digital marketing manager for a small company also.
Well, this is a vague question. Digital marketing is like a car. You've got tire guys, radiator gals, engine people, paint folks. 
Same goes for digital marketing. I can ask my search engine marketing guy what I should do about social media and he may have some advice but probably not the best advice. 
To look at it even deeper version people specialize in vw engines. Just vw engines. That's it. Certain people also specialize in just Instagram marketing. And that's it. 
I’m currently open right now to new opportunities. I love my job but at almost 2.5 years in the same role I’m
Ready for more eventually.... I had to sit down and really think what it is I do at my job. I had a list of about 20 things. I then went on LinkedIn and looked up similar jobs and honed down. Like someone else said on here, Digital Marketers aren’t a one size fits all. Some specialize in things that others don’t and vice versa..
My company has 3 people. My marketing manager, my UX designer, and me. My role is Marketing Communications Specialist. I oversee all of our Email marketing campaigns , I analyze data , I work on our website , I do our social media, I work our in person events I work on our mobile app. I basically had to take all this kitchen sink of duties that I oversee and pick and pull the skills within those that are relevant. 
If I were you, a good start is email marketing. Set up a mail chimp account and practice. Do marketing for a non profit ( I did that for experience before Landing this job) just get as much exposure as possible ... take anything that gives you an offer if you stand behind the company 
Broncohouse is dead on. I can do most things that fall under the digital marketing umbrella but my expertise is in SEM/PPC. Find your lane and master it. 
Once you're able to produce solid traffic,you will have a LOT MORE OPTIONS
Regardless, the key is to master driving traffic and OPTIMIZING CONVERSIONS. These are powerful digital marketing skill sets worth GOLD!
It is used synonymously, although I've never seen someone who actually works in marketing call it "internet marketing". Digital is the term that is currently used. 
Digital Marketing and Internet Marketing are like objects of the same class.  Digital Marketing is like a broad term that describes a set of marketing processes that encapsulates all available digital channels to promote a product or service or build a digital brand. Internet marketing is a subset of digital marketing. As a whole Internet marketing can be sub categorized as Website, Search Marketing, Content Marketing, Email Marketing, Ads and many more. 
Digital marketing is not restricted only to internet channels but also extends to non-Internet channels that provide digital media, such as mobile phones (SMS, callback) etc. In other words, Internet marketing is a subset of digital marketing. The extension to non-Internet channels differentiates digital marketing from internet marketing.
 From my point of view, internet marketing and digital marketing is interrelated terms. Digital marketing carry internet marketing(SEO, PPC) plus phone messages, digital advertising(FB, Twitter,Instagram). 
  Digital marketing is a broad term that describes a set of marketing processes that encapsulates all available digital channels to promote a product or service or build a digital brand.
Internet marketing is a subset of digital marketing. It is in fact the most important component since the majority of digital marketing activities fall within the boundaries of Internet marketing.
5) Clickfunnels is garbage, though the client will refer to them frequently during all negotiations
10) Do the right thing and don't be evil (but define "evil" as loosely as Google does)
Enlighten me about Clickfunnels
**4. Be patient:** The success of social networks and digital marketing, content do not happen overnight. Although it is possible to catch a lightning bolt in a bottle, it is likely that you will need to commit long term to achieve results. The secret lies in finding the appropriate language for your audience. 
A major change is that you become far more involved in strategy. You still end up doing a lot of the grunt work you were doing before, but now you're really able to shape these projects, rather than just having to execute them.
I went from nothing next to nothing to becoming digital marketing manager over the last two years. I started off learning Facebook/Instagram ads from someone in the company who eventually ended up leaving. After really growing their online sales for a year and a half they decided to promote me. Now I still am in charge of Facebook/Instagram ads like before, but I also am in charge of testing new platforms and apps and reaching out to potential influencers. So it’s not too different from what I was doing before, just more responsibilities and better pay. 
FYI the company I work for was really small when I started and blew up over the last year or so. If they were already more established it probably would have taken longer to move from entry level to manager. 
I have a funnel in place that is maybe 4-5 steps. The owners actually write/make awesome content that I make sure gets sent to the best audiences and the budgets are where they should be. 
I've managed to become a manager in a span of 9 months and increased my salary 400%. I started out as a marketing assistant and the agency I used to work on back then decided to give me away to their client because the client really liked my work they wanted to take me as a part of their in house marketing team. It took a lot of reading and experimenting though and work doesnt really stop at my office. Also, part of it is your bargaining power specially with promotions and salary increase you should also be good at seeing your worth and making people notice it. 
P.s. getting the right certifications helps in career growth too. 
Yes.. I began working in another role and got promoted to a Digital MarCom role. My next step is MarCom manager or Digital Marketing Manager. 
I have more work but I use the same technology. It has forced me to be more organized that’s for sure 
I feel Like I will be stuck as an assistant forever. I’m very sick of creating posts though. Going nuts at work, no perspective of growing 
It all depends. Assuming you hire quality people, it's likely better to hire an agency for multiple services vs. different freelancers. Pricing is impossible to say without understanding the industry or what the needs are. Anyone who tosses out a flat rate without understanding your business and goals, walk away. We see what all is needed, what the budget is, and base the monthly fee off of how many hours we will be dedicating to the client each month. 
We map our customers through a process based on human psychology that turns them from strangers to brand advocates - I.e they’re out actively referring people to businesses.
So many times full service means they might do one thing really well but actually suvk at another. However they are visually appealing. 
I spent 6k 5 years ago on a company that got me two sales equaling about$30. 
Be careful before going all in on an agency. I work with a bunch. Many times they just talk about their experience but actually have no idea what is happening right now
It seems to me that you need to clarify your 2019 marketing goals. If you are running everything yourself and asking about cost for a freelancer V an agency, I'm going to assume your budget is small. Which is fine, however you can't and won't get everything. So pick what it the furthest from your own area of expertise and get an agency or Freelancer which operates in this area. Outsource Google Ads, SM ads/posts, image creation, stuff which doesn't require an intimate knowledge of the business. As for the content marketing, if you are a smaller business and really know your stuff, you won't be happy with the content a non-expert writes for your blog anyway - so keep that in house. I'd also suggest, if you know a bit about Adwords, keeping an eye on what is working and what's been done by your freelancer or agency - if you aren't versed in it - hire a guy once off every 6 months to audit the work - I've seen thousands burned by agencies not monitoring accounts for businesses which assumed they were getting a good service. I can't give you a price range as I know nothing about your businesses or plans. Good Luck. 
One client may say “I would like a landing page for each of my 3 services” while another would like one for each of the 200 cities they service. 
You’ll definitely need to more clearly define “full service”. Do you want a text ad Google campaign plus 3 blog posts a month simulposted to Facebook or do you want a weekly social video, custom content for Instagram daily blogging, twitter/Facebook community management, high end google ppc management, a/b landing page testing, display/remarketing with animated banners etc.
My guess is you don’t really know what all you want/need and might prefer to have multiple agencies pitch you various service levels and price points. If your annual digital marketing budget is at least 500k this might be a worthwhile exercise. If not, you won’t be able to afford to work with the good agencies and likely only weak agencies who overpromise/underdeliver will even give you a new business song and dance.
If you’re in the 100k-500k range and need some help choosing high ROI efforts to keep scaling up your business, hiring an experienced digital consultant like me to help you create a plan and evaluate vendors could be a good option. Feel free to message me if you’d like to.

SALESmanago - very simple, but powerful software. Includes all necessary Marketing Automation tools.
Here is pretty much EVERYTHING I use on a regular basis in my job. I have been a Digital Marketing Manager / Strategist for about 6+ years. I hope you find something you're not using, but I also want to know if you have something I missed / if you can recommend a more powerful tool to replace any of these. Thanks!
AdBlock Plus Chrome Extension: Blocks advertisements while browsing the web.
Adobe Brackets: Free text editor I use for editing HTML, CSS, Javascript files.
Amino Chrome Extension: Saves custom CSS code for individual websites / web pages. This is seriously helpful if you constantly have to reload the Facebook home page in your job because you can remove all the stuff on there that you don't need to see every time (increases page load speed). Requires minor (sometimes decent) CSS skills. I mostly use it for Facebook, but for a few other sites too.
Dropbox: Cloud-based file storage - works on every device. We use this to distribute large files externally and internally. We also put backups on here so that they're not stored locally clogging up our Macbooks.
Formstack: A form tool that can easily be linked with Zapier to help with automated processes. Considering moving to Typeform, but we have so much automation running through Formstack that it'll be a huge project.
Google Docs: A powerful browser-based document editing software that allows multiple users to work on a file at the same time. If you use Microsoft Office in your workplace, still use this for individual projects (you can Export a file as a .doc / .docx format anyway).
Google Sheets: A powerful browser-based spreadsheet software that allows multiple users to work on a file at the same time. This is my go-to for our Content Calendar of what we're posting and when.
Grammarly Chrome Extension: Omfg. If you're in a Marketing role, just get Grammarly, okay? If you're a Manager - make your employees get it. It's not perfect, but if you have a decent grasp of grammar anyway, it can spot mistakes or make recommendations. Full disclosure: couldn't be bothered running this post through Grammarly. Don't message me if I made a mistake, I don't care :D.
Hotjar: GDPR-friendly, secure user tracking tool that can create heatmaps, scrollmaps and even screen recordings of user activity on a website. A really great way to do UX testing.
Mailchimp: I've used Mailchimp, Campaign Monitor, Dotmailer, in-house systems, and I've even created HTML templates from scratch. I just like Mailchimp over other platforms. I've never worked in a company where the pricing makes that much difference, so I usually get to choose the platform I want to use.
Reddit: Yep - I even use Reddit in my job, but only to find interesting blog-post ideas. Go on any subreddit related to your field of work. Switch to Top Posts, and select the last month. See if there's anything decent to write about that you don't already know.
Tweetdeck: I hate this app, but it makes message replies, scheduling posts, following competitor accounts, extremely easy.
Webmerge: A merging tool that allows you to upload a file with {tags} that reference something (think something like a field on Formstack). So, a customer fills in their {Name} etc. and then Webmerge creates an Excel file that looks like our PDF order form with {Name} on it already. We have about 120 different tags that merge on to this spreadsheet. It then auto-emails the Excel sheet to the correct Salesperson who can then edit and save as a PDF. Sounds complicated, but it's okay once you get used to it, and removes hours of work for the Sales team.
Yummy FTP Lite: Used to manage files on servers. If more functions are required there is also a ‘Pro’ version, but so far this has been suitable for all tasks I've needed it for.
Zapier: An automation tool that is invaluable to saving time and effort with moving data between multiple services. For example, creating a populated spreadsheet row on Google Sheets for every person who filled in a Facebook Lead Gen advert. Hundreds of possibilities to save time across the whole team. I could talk about this all day as well, but I don't want to. Go check it out!
Completely! You have put it very well and I feel the same way... I also have friends who are in the same boat.
You so well put into words what I've been feeling the last few months. I'm only 2-3 years into the CM game coming from a journalism background and it's really hard to find learning sources that aren't either incredibly basic (step 1: make content people like! ...), or incredibly specific for an individual client or niche industry. Have attended some different "boot camps" as well but it's just more of the same. Claims after claim with no real data or proof to back them up. So when I do want to try something I read online, it feels like the blind risk falls entirely on me and my team. Stressful. 
Been working in Digital Marketing for the last few years. Absolutely 100% agree with you and it frustrates the shit out of me. In fact, it frustrated me so much that I left the industry for 6 months but then decided to come back and I'm happy I did. But it's time to start making a change in the industry, at least at the ground level, by controlling what we can control. Would love to talk more sometime.
People almost turn into the persona. They are constantly trying to squeeze value out of themselves as a professional. Sometimes it just seems too forced. 
It almost seems arrogant. 
Not only is there a lot of content to learn about, digest and implement but you now have the added hurdle of sifting through and filtering all the people marketing to the marketers and such.  But I guess you can say you'll have this in every industry to some extent, right?
Thank you for so articulately explaining this phenomenon. I don't understand how Digital Marketing somehow devolved into this Buzzfeed-like crap. I work in high-tech and market for a very small niche audience. I'm writing technical content for primarily sys admins who don't want to read another fucking listical, but I'm constantly feeling pressured to push the "cutesy" stuff. I really hope something turns around soon and we can start seeing more technical, evidence-based advice for content marketing. I will say the YouMoz blog will turn up a great article every once in a while that has very thorough research and evidence to back up claims. Other than that it's been pretty dry. Good luck, though!
I do have a problem with reaching people who might need our products. I am not sure what it is I'm lacking but you can see our facebook page https://www.facebook.com/cornerstonesystem/ I was thinking that facebook is not a good place to market this kind of product though I have linkedin and instagram profiles. Can anyone enlighten me? thanks
Source/medium is important (make sure all traffic is UTM tagged!)
Gather data about the audience- where they came from, what they did, and their characteristics. 
CXL has s great course on GA, pricey though . 
Learn data studio!
Search digital marketing in [Udemy.com](https://Udemy.com)
And try [Lynda.com](https://Lynda.com) too
Does anyone here go with classroom instead of online course? I get it that online course is cheaper, efficient, and available anywhere and anytime as long as you have internet connection.
Take a look on YouTube. There's a tonne of video tutorials for all aspects of digital marketing. Pick ONE and make it work for you. 
twitter flight school is also free
Digital Marketing is almost the same like traditional marketing, means you have a product or service that you want to sell, and you’re looking to find the ways to engage with customers and generate sales. It is a fast growing and incredibly competitive industry so you need to stay update on top of current news and latest trends by following major digital marketing sites. Here I am sharing some recommendations on websites to get started learning and practices: 
I just finished my digital marketing agency website. I'm looking for business partners to collaborate with. If you're interested send me a line.
I’m not sure why, but I feel like it’s hard to find a good group. Although I really like this one. Most of my LinkedIn groups have died down over the years and now are just spammy.
Free online training: HubSpot
[https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/inbound-success-podcast/id1277969726?mt=2](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/inbound-success-podcast/id1277969726?mt=2) Inbound Success Podcast, weekly interviews with industry experts to talk about how they find digital marketing success.
[https://www.hubspot.com/podcasts/skill-up](https://www.hubspot.com/podcasts/skill-up) Skill up by HubSpot is one of my favorites. It's a limited series run that's about SEO, but they do a great job of being comprehensive about what works now, what used to work and no longer does, and why things are the way they are in the world of search. 
I know you didn't mention books, but there are a few that have really influenced me as a digital marketer that are still relevant:
Wordsteam for social media
These are not really courses but ultimates guides.
Doesn’t mean less spending on google ads, just mean people are moving away from text ads and moving toward dynamic and responsive.
ppc will never be gone until Google is gone. 70% of their revenue comes from Google ads.
 \* Voice Search also trends in Digital Marketing
The growth has been rapid and exponential. It's obvious why.  If the founder said he was going to take on the Gaints, who would have not made fun of him.
Machine learning and deep learning - it will help with cross media attribution modeling so we can find out what works (with reasonable accuracy of > 50%).
The increased implementation of AI in database vendors like ZoomInfo. This will be absolutely huge for targeting if they are able to keep the database up-to-date in real time. Right now I find most of the large databases to be totally useless.
Verge3D, this is totally a game-changer in e-commerce. 
i am majoring in digital marketing at my university.
It depends on where you're at in your digital marketing career. If you're just starting out and need a comprehensive overview courses do come in handy. If you're looking to up skill courses do help to.
But if you don't put what you learn into practice, it really is counter productive. I personally bought a few courses from Udemy when I was starting out and it helped get me up to speed with my more experienced colleagues 
Honestly it depends on what kind of digital marketing you’d like to get into. I’ve heard good things about cereal entrepreneur’s course “digital marketing school” and it’s not too expensive. Not sponsored - I’m looking at taking it since it covers the big picture of running an agency and is reasonably priced at around $500 or a payment plan of $180 ish monthly for a couple months. I’ve been doing more freelance work for businesses for a while, and recently set up the framework for an actual agency. I think this course would be a good next step for me personally to further my knowledge. 
Unfortunately I spent a good amount of money on a course that wasn’t really all it cracked up to be. It covered mainly Facebook ads, landing pages, email marketing, and did have some good templates for getting clients and ad campaign targeting for different niches. The bright side though was that it helped me dip my toes into digital marketing, led to making the jump to quit my 9-5 I hated, and working for myself. So it worked out I guess.
As per my suggestion, join any digital marketing institute near your home & practice everything at your own after the class. 
Yes. It is worth it.
Micro-moments marketing will rock the stage in 2019. Micro-moments are the new type of customer behavior. Customers mostly use their devices such as phones to find something they want and Google tracks it within a span of seconds and displays them the required results.
A few trends I think we’ll see in 2019:
1. Higher Quality Content: the internet has become saturated with content. Everyone has a blog. It will take more and more to stand out and get noticed.
Worst super bowl ads ever 
More shitty Digital Marketing agency startups that want money and retainers and don’t know crap about marketing.
That sounds awful and is my #1 fear with looking for marketing jobs at bigger companies. I think you would be a better fit at a smaller company as an in-house “jack of all trades” marketing guy/gal. Or maybe even a freelance marketing consultant. Most large companies are filled with bureaucracy and red tape because there are so many moving parts, checks and balances, and outdated processes in place. Oftentimes, managers would rather sign off on what’s in their best interest or what makes them look good over what’s really best for the company or their team members. That’s what happens when a company gets too big for its own good.
Change jobs, especially if you think you only need to work for 1 hour out of your working day. In house roles should revolve around short & longterm strategy and implementing said strategy, not "optimise my SEO" in 15 mins, which would set alarm bells off for any manager.
Also, viral =/ business success, which is probably why your company isn't that pushed about it.
Apologies about the grammar. Typed this on the train for 3 mins
When I look for keywords, I analyze 1 million rows of data at a time.
Smaller companies want to know why it’s important and what you do. 
The change I suggest for larger companies is stop talking effort and start talking benefit. 
Outcomes, not inputs. 
- What can you do for me
- Why I need it
- How can I get it (give me something easy to say yes to)
If it isn't the CEO but the Marketing Director at a larger business show and demonstrate the value he can then communicate to his boss (and take the credit).  
Have actual numbers and valid results of how it improved their business. Cool so you improved their page speed/google ranking etc. WTF did that change in terms of customers/revenue/ etc.  
It seems a bit dodgy, but nobody got fired by copying their biggest competitor/doing more than them. They often do for missing out on what those competitors are doing.   
Did the same thing last year. Totally undervalued myself just to get the gig for some extra vacation money. Value your skill set. They are lucky to get your services.
Are you thinking of consulting for them on a continuous basis? Or for a specific project? I'd bid total cost on a project, but hourly for a continuous gig.  
It seems like you have $40 per hour. I would go for the money that your company charge for that kind of service and cut that in a half, so you will be providing a better value for that money. I am thinking about hour charge of your company would be somewhere around $150 so you should be doubling your hour salary with $75/hour. I don't know your company charges, can you tell them?
Hey sorry to bother you but what do I have to study to have a position that you are in? Where can I find this information? What books should I read? Any YouTube channels or blogs I should checkout? It’s hard to look for credible sources because most people are trying to sell their version of material. Any insight will be helpful. Thanks. 
Set monthly management fee +15% commission.
$2000 a month for up to X hours, anything over that is $150/h. No commission, gets messy with tracking, honesty, longevity, etc
I used a good one called the 1 in 12 digital marketing guide from Udemy.com.
The first guy I learned from learned everything he knew from Udemy courses. For me personally hands on experience has been the best way to learn. I emailed every marketing agency in the area, even the ones without open positions posted and eventually got hired in an entry level spot where they taught me a ton. 
I don't think they should start with Facebook Ads. They are expensive until you have enough traffic that the retargeting is cost effective. They should start with Google Ads (probably) and Email Marketing. 
First off, why is every new post in here immediately downvoted? The question may be something you think is dumb but maybe it'll help others out.
So a few things. It sounds like this is a client to just move away from. I'd tell him, look we need to test everything. I will test both simultaneously, along with different targeting, age groups etc., and whichever does the best we will put more budget into. Obviously the ones that aren't working, we will turn off.
You should never decided between FB or IG without testing. Either way it usually boils down to who the target audience is. Age is a huge factor.
As the others have mentioned, if FB fits into your target audience, it's worth a test.
I've often sought out answers to questions elsewhere because of this, which is odd, because reddit is typically the go-to place when i have questions regarding a specific niche category.
There are a few nuggets of wisdom here...Overall, it seems like large groups of digital marketers are deathly paranoid that people will steal their job, and down vote anything posted here to oblivion. o_O
There are no responses here, but it's a good question.
Did you get any suggestions elsewhere? What did you end up reading, if you don't mind me asking?
Priests demand more wisdom of light.
I don't mean to be a "heretic" but I think one of the biggest things lost is "what is acceptable content" & "real SEO."  You could ask one SEO'er and they will scream to the gods: it is "long form content with 3K plus words on a page", another may say "Q & A style!". The fact is many posts are all about what "Google wants you to do".  But then there is the reality of what you should really be doing.
You have the "purists" that follow the holy grail of the "google bible", then you have the "sinners", the ones figuring out the real truth behind the church.  In the end, the balance needs to be found between the two, because to be honest, going full religious fanatic will actually yield you very little results.
This one is easy. Here’s something I did about a year ago. 
I unfollowed all the useless shit. I unfollowed the meme pages, sports, celebrity’s, trash news, etc. I kept only my close friends, family, co-workers. Most importantly, I followed successful entrepreneurs, motivational speakers, brands I want to gain inspiration from, financial advice, etc. 
Social media often gets a bad rep. But it’s not social media, it’s the people and the things you follow. Your phone (and subsequently, social media) counts as one of the five people your spend the most time with in your life. This means you’re greatly impacted by the things you do on your phone. 
Create your social media environment into something constructive. Since I did this, I actually spend far less time on social media. I’m not always in the mood to scroll through my timeline anymore. But that’s a good thing. 
I am a digital marketing manager and it depends on which aspect of digital marketing you want to work in. If you want to paid media then yes, need to understand how social works and purchased. Or if you want to go into analytics, you may need to know how the data works for social media. Or you can go into ad ops (just implementing campaigns) or go into strategy. Don’t need to know a whole bunch but just how it is used for the overall strategy of the brand. But still nice to know. 
Posting and building social accounts is a pain and something I dislike, but I do the above often and is beneficial.
1: you don't *have* to do anything. You should be using the channels that are most appropriate/most profitable for your business. On social in particular, people think they have to be everywhere,  and keep pumping out content all the time. You could just as easily put one ad on Facebook and keep it running for 3 months, and do nothing else. If it works, it works. 
2: social for business is not like social for personal use. Your audience may behave in ways that are completely contrary to the way you behave on social. Use numbers and analytics to see what works. If it is for a business, then social media should always have a clear tie to your business - whether thats a product, a service, facilities, people... social should be messaging that you have a clear reason for putting out, and thatnprovides specific value for the customer. You don't even need to follow any other sources if you don't want to, as long as what you are doing makes sense and has a clear objective. 
Hell no. I've been an affiliate marketer that specializes in email marketing for over 11 years and I've won awards in the industry and I'm a 7 figure earner and my Instagram account has maybe two hundred people. While social media can be an effective tool nothing beats knowing you make x amount of dollars spending x amount of dollars and that just won't happen with posting on social media. Hit me up if you want to learn more but the basics are this dot-dot-dot I collect large email address list through digital marketing I offset my ad cost wall collecting those people at the same time and I monetize it further through email marketing. Most times I post on here I got some haters but the truth is the whole bunch of us that make really good livings doing digital marketing... And we are not influencers and we have been doing this for a long time.
You have to have an incredible understanding of social media and it’s intricacies, as well as trends and sudden changes of tech and direction, because social media is what drives digital marketing trends. 
One of the best ways to do this is 'lumpy mail'. When I first started I would record a video of me auditing their social media and then put it on a flash drive and mail it to them in a gold padded envelope. 
What does having a lot of followers have to do with being a credible social marketer?
2. Multi-level entry into a funnel
1. Analyzing your competitors' funnel(Use "similar web" to get basic ideas, combine with "Ahrefs")
1. try reaching out beyond your existing audience
2. thought leadership, i.e. speaking at conferences/workshops
What digital marketers do is find ways to drive traffic to websites and generate leads for businesses. It revolves around driving traffic to/through a marketing funnel, which is the process that brings them to the website/landing page, which has whatever product or service they are looking for.
There’s different ways to do this, including running paid ads to drive traffic through the marketing funnel. Search engine optimization and content strategy to build up your website’s authority is also big for getting organic traffic and building trust with your audience. And social media engagement is another way to provide value to potential clients. Paid fb ads is something different but also a powerful way to reach targeted audiences.
But basically, they use different channels (google, bing, fb/Instagram, and whatever else)  to get people who could be interested in a potential product/service to the website that can help serve them. Also optimizing the website to handle all the incoming traffic is a big part of it too.
I'm one of them and I just press buttons & watch my screen change colors.
Marketing is an important part of any business. If the marketing is low of any business than the business is not going to sustain no matter how much money he/she invests. A **digital marketer** is responsible for developing, implementing and managing marketing campaigns that promote a company’s products or services. 
* Website Analysis and Audit to find the loop holes, fixing errors to improve the website performance.
* Liaise between content writers, web development, SEO/Link Builder, Graphic Designers Teams to increase user experience
Digital Marketing is still new relatively. Digital marketers are responsible for developing online marketing strategy, design and write web content, promotional posts, communicating brand awareness and messages to online users. Gather data and generate analysis reports.

What tends to be complicated is the strategy and the execution.
It is essentially marketing (driving business growth by offering products/services in demand), using digital services.
The company what you chose for travelling, the plane you flew, all those decision you made while travelling is what Digital Marketers did to make you take that.
A business owner could do all of this themselves, but often times a digital marketer has to manage 5+ social media accounts, 25 posts a day, regular search engine optimization updates, preventing spam/competitors of the business outdoing ads, and basic web IT all for one client.

Bullshit career
There is a young guy on YouTube called James A. Brinker who runs his own digital marketing agency and I believe he’s 16-17. 
Hey man good on you it's a lucrative industry with tons of opportunity. even if you don't end up in digital long term it's an incredibly useful skill to have. 
Pick a niche and smash it. I wish I listened to this. We now do paid traffic for e-commerce stores only and it works better as people have more trust in this (we also run a branding agency on the side as a separate entity). Become an expert in one field and then expand. 
Always happy to spit ball ideas if you want, feel free to pm me 
Most businesses are looking for a good return to investment and don't care about age...
If you start now, you will be ahead of the game. It would be hard getting an actual digital marketing role but if you can find a local shop that has no online visibility try working for them and building up their visibility online and getting results. Show that you can drive financial returns based on what you do online. Learning the skills and Portfolio building are everything at your stage.
>Unless you have a time machine to go back to 2008, you need to seriously re-evaluate your marketing plan if you think Facebook is still the "free" marketing platform it once was. Facebook's current algorithm and cost of ads has almost put it on par (probably even more expensive) than Google AdWords for many industries.
>If you haven't got at least $100 per month to be boosting the odd post, you shouldn't even be using Facebook.
"So you're in Digital Marketing right? Can you fix my computer?"
Great list, especially number four. People always want to put the cart before the horse. 
> So when will Google find this on my site?
Smiling.  Now take what you've experienced and make it global: Just yesterday I got an angry, blaming email from Saudi that Google didn't immediately crawl the brand-new site, and yes it was submitted and yes, the SEO's in good shape (in Arabic to boot), and no I can't tell Google what to do.
Also, the facebook thing? As a consumer that hacks me off because there are a few businesses (like local restaurants) that I do want to see their offers and I have to override the settings to see their posts.
Yikes, what a horrible waste of money
Working in a small company, people think I am the IT guy. People are surprised I can't fix servers! 
Made me laugh.. the struggle is real! Especially that last one. I'm not your IT guy! 
They also have a Facebook Group full of marketing pros that has been really helpful to me in the past when I need recommendations or advice.
Search engine journal, ad exchanger, ppc hero, and wordstream.
Find a way to start buying ads on Facebook and AdWords. Try to get on a major DSP as well.
Learn as much as you can about GA but also business. What you do impacts a business at the end of the day. Once you master all the routine bits... start to figure out how to put in processes, automate and generally free up your time to take on bigger tasks.
Focus on today and tomorrow will take care of itself for work. You might want to do SEO, but you want to do something else once you start working. Never a bad idea to have a website to mess around.. I always had one going on when I started out. Gives you chance to do stuff you may can not do at work.   
I worked in all. Agency, in house, and consulting. Great career with an overwhelming amount of channels and concepts. From technical SEO to blogging, there’s so many areas to specialize in.
I love my career and that’s what I did!
Try to understand all the sides of digital marketing. Not just ads, but SEO, web dev, analytics. 
Lastly, and I cannot stress this enough, don't get too drunk at office parties. 
2. Content Strategy  (quality content, viral content, linkbait)
If your studies were non marketing related, go find an internship in the field of your degree. You don't seem like you'll be happy until you go where your passions will feed you. Work is work... but you're too young in your career to already feel this frustrated. Switch up before you settle in.

You will pay tax on the earnings but not sales tax. I don’t think that is a county/state decision but a federal decision.  I could be wrong. I don’t charge sales tax on marketing services. 
Just be able to prove wins for customers.. best part of digital marketing... Results should be the only thing that matters...
No matter what you decide to showcase- make sure you are comfortable speaking about it! It should be yours! We had candidates that brought a booming portfolio, but with no knowledge to back it up - it doesn't hold for long in the interview.
Google Platinum has been really useful but shh...don't tell anyone.
There are very few secrets. Like any professional field it takes hard work over time to get results. If you're looking for a silver bullet you are most likely barking up the wrong tree.
In my experience, the tools you need really depend on your industry/niche. Some tools might be really helpful for one industry but useless in another. 
What kind of tools? Digital advertising is so wide there is so much out there. 
The secret... it's all powered by Excel...
Or the Microsoft office suite in general. Most used tool for data analysis... Excel. Dashboard, Excel (export to PDF). Budget tracking, Excel. Accounting, Excel. Project management, Outlook message threads. Gantt charts, Excel. Note system, Microsoft word. Password management, Excel. 360 Reviews, Word + Excel. Team collaboration, Word (though saved on share drive)... I encourage the community to add to the list..
'secret' tools don't exist, why would someone develop a tool and not publicise it? IMO it comes down to personal preference and ways of working. Also cost, some of the enterprise level tools are very expensive. 
Ahref, Moz, spyfu these are some tools which is publicaly available but you have to buy it and cost ratio is way high ...
Yes, some expertise's are refuse to tell tools like free email ids tools, used in email marketing, such as AutoPitch, MailChimp, Drip and etc. some lead generation tool like leadfuse, AutoPitch and etc.
hubspot has an entire academy that’s completely free and incredible. hootsuite also has free courses with certifications online that are very respected.

No matter whatever course you take whether it is Facebook, Instagram there is one thing that you need to know and practice, copywriting skills, without it, you will have very little success. Knowing how to create ads is one thing, know how to create ads and landing pages that convert is a whole different story. My suggestion is to get started with learning copywriting. When I first started SEO and created an affiliate site to review digital pianos, I was getting 35 to 50K visitors per month to my site but converting very few visitors to click to the merchant. I was at a turning point, Get more traffic or learn to convert the traffic I already had. I opted to learn to convert existing traffic and I am glad I did learn to write conversion copy. Talk to any experienced digital marketer and they will say the same.
There’s some great courses on Udemy. I got all the basics down from one called Digital Marketing Masterclass by Phil Ebiner. I’m in no way promoting him, I just managed to learn quite a bit from the course, but I’m sure that there are others out there that he can pick up. 
Apart from that, I think another thing that he can do to make himself more valuable to an employer would be to brush up on his business analytics skills. It’s pretty easy to get data and statistics for the digital marketing campaigns that you do nowadays, even if it just one video or a single blogpost, you can still get useful data on it, for e.g. how many people view it, how long is spent on an article, etc. 
He could start in sales for large agencies. Too many agencies hire sales people without digital marketing knowledge. 
I've had this conversation with a **sales** guy in his early 40's who wanted to move to digital marketing. Here is what I observed:
* He was unsure about what function in digital to pick up
* He did not seem self-confident enough about being able to learn
**Copywriting** is one of the most obvious choices but it is a good option only if he is quite frankly good at communication. So this would be depending upon the kind of organisations he worked for in his sales career. But then again, I'm guessing you're in India and getting copywriting gigs for a new to industry copywriter at 55 seems really hard.
What you could do for him is use your contacts to get freelance work and delegate bits and pieces of it to him. This would help him learn and get a little bit of self-confidence. Involve him in the thinking process even for the things that you decide to do yourself. For example, if you take up social media management, ask him for suggestions on what type of communication would fit into a certain content basket. Let him watch you flesh out what you guys discussed into an actual creative and a post. Gradually maybe he can take it over himself.
First, let me congratulate your dad for having the strength and the spirit to learn something new at this age. Admirable.
To learn the trade he must:
1. UNLEARN how traditional sales work. Selling over the phone, face to face or hard selling (not saying he is selling this way, but I am mentioning it), is totally different from "selling" or marketing over the web, especially in the age of permission-based marketing and subtle marketing techniques.
2. He could transition easier if he moves from that field to learning direct response advertising. Books like  Scientific Advertising by Claude C. Hopkins, or The Ultimate Sales Letter by Dan Kennedy or even Ogilvy on Advertising (although this is very old but its advise is still relevant) will give him a good direction if this is what he wants to do.
4. He also needs to specialise is an area, at first. If he could write, he could learn how Google Ads and Facebook ads work, so he can write copy that persuades.
5. As someone mentioned here, he could learn a few basic skills (Google has lessons on selling ads) and then seek employment at advertising agencies.
If it was my dad, and I was sure he was exploring that path, then what I would do is call up a few agencies in the area, and ask if they could book a meeting with me and my dad to ask them a few questions about "a possible cooperation". 
To invoke the meeting I would say that my dad is unemployed and wants to see if they can sell for them in a commission-only basis. That would pick their interest to book a meeting. Upon being in the room I would tell them that my dad wants to enter the digital marketing space and then get their feedback.
Hope this helps!
Selling hours is the fast way to talk about hours and not the outcome... more sales/customer/revenue.. that you want. I would not get paid on gross profit. What if they change the pricing of a product... profits go down and you make less. Either they pay you like an employee or they hire you as an agency. This comes across like they want the best of both worlds and you take a hit if anything goes wrong. An account could be anything.. if one account is more work, you get paid the same for that work vs another that is half the work. If they want to outsource to you. Then pay you like an agency.
Data Science is almost entirely reserved for masters & PHD students. Not something I am saying is impossible for others, but one does not simply just use machine learning with out knowing what the hell they are doing. (basically what I am saying is that unless you are doing it full-time 40+ hours a week you are wasting your time although understanding how it works is definitely a good idea)
Tablaeu is just a data visualization software that runs querys (SQL) in the background with no coding involved. 
Edit: before anybody asks yes you can make graphs in R with libraris such as GGplot2, but that would be a nightmare to use as a digital marketer when there are so many better tools out there. 
Well... everyone has to start somewhere. So I’ll say yes you definitely can get a job with little to no experience so long as you look for entry level roles specifically in the coordinator/specialist positions. My agency took newbies with almost no knowledge and trained them into experts who went on to bigger and better companies. I think if you show them you have some background knowledge you’re at least familiar with concepts and landscapes but would need a job to apply those concepts in a real life setting. 
I got a job with about 9 month of freelance experience. I had four clients, a website and a few certificates in Google and Bing. I eventually started looking for full time gigs and got hired as an account manager within a month. I was also looking in NYC, so location def plays a role. I'm from a totally outside field but found I could emphasize my related experiences, like writing, editing, and public speaking. 
I had the same question I applied for for some entry level positions but didn't really make it came close once but that's it now I'm looking for Internships
Hey, new mod here. I'm On it. Please keep reporting to help me with clean up.
Agreed. Definitely spent like 29 minutes today just reporting random shit posts and blatant self promotion. Including one guy who posted at least a dozen duplicate text posts with no content inside. 
The spam is ridiculous lately. 
Click to report the bad posts: that helps the mods out by flagging them.  I just now reported yet another SEO solicitation.
But in a different vein, I just got two unsolicited PMs this morning offering wares to me, both asking my to contact them via skype.  Now that's gone too far.
I agree, I hate all the spam on this sub. It prevents me from wanting to come here.
Couldn't agree more. Thank you for taking initiative on this issue. 
I’ve been doing it for 10 years without any certifications. I think proven results are what counts. I don’t think it’s affected my career. 
With or without certificates, your way into the field is to take a shitty entry level gig to get experience and get out ASAP.
I’ve worked in Digital Marketing for 3 years . Just got promoted to Marketing Communications Manager.. 
I primarily do the following: 
- maintain social media channels / build social strategy
-oversee and manage brochure and print materials
- develop our marketing strategy along the different channels we utilize to reach our audience 
I do track my data and I am implementing automation to ... all things you can learn on the job...
Learn the platforms. Don't rely on getting the "good stuff" from any of these online course. Do the research. Watch the trends. FREELANCE. Take internships. Create some free campaigns for family, friends, family friends, whomever, to learn what areas or industries you enjoy the most. The best thing you can learn from is failure in digital marketing. It is not easy in the field, and this is not to deter you. It's the honest (and sometimes crushing) truth. So when you get shut down over and over, or have unhappy clients, just remember, this is apart of the process and don't give up.
**Valuable Assets to have in D.M.:**
2. Being able to read the data and make data driven decisions using Google Analytics 
5. Premiere editing skills. Even if they are mid-tier. Being able to film and/or take prerecorded video, and make a little 30-45 second video clips for your campaigns is so valuable. Video ads are really starting to gain traction, so it's nice to be able to *spice* things up when refreshing your ads.
6. SEO, I guess. But that's gonna be a no from me, fam. Just not my thing. 
People want a "jack of all trades" these days in D.M.. Because if not, you have literally hire 6 vendors, and NO ONE likes having that many (overpriced) vendors. Good luck, bud. We'll see you out there. **And stop spending all that money on shitty online courses.**
I've been doing digital marketing for some time now. Only once I've been asked about a certificate (i think it was that Facebook blueprint someone was mentioning). And this one time I was applying for the career in one big agency. Clients care only about the experience and how can you make them some moneeeyyy! :D
You can start your own agency without college experience. So just proof of knowledge.
Certificates can help you land a job in the industry. Results will make you grow and stay in the industry
Honestly, none
Learn to sell. Cars, real estate, vacuum cleaners, digital ad campaigns... doesn’t matter. Actual practical experience getting verbally abused by customers who either don’t want it, or only want it if they can have it yesterday for half the price and in a different color will teach you more about how to advertise than 1000 hours watching udemy videos.
Manager - usually manages camapign and all the employees working on it. I currently hold this role and I delegate tasks and meet with the client etc etc. (short version)
If you're new I would shoot for analyst and or coordinator. I would not hire ANYONE without at least 2 yrs experience. I have been in this industry for about ten years now and have seen plenty of people come and go. You need the experience with clients not just with the execution of the campaign. In my opinion that is where the value of experience comes in.
Digital marketing is a vast field which has many things like SEO, SMO, SEM, SMM, Content marketing, Understand the market etc. In the end I would like to say that a beginner should start from one by one.
Look at the requirements for marketing - analyst, executive, marketer, assistant jobs. They often end up being the most common titles for people with little experience.
Didn’t really impact me too much, nothing I can’t do later on anyway. 
Another reason why we shouldn’t become dependant on any single platform and to diversify.
I didn’t, but I had to listen to my partner bitch bout it 
Just a dip in scale but we're evergreen so it wasn't that devastating. Also the API still works fine 
That was the longest outage I have experienced I believe. So glad it's up and running. Thankfully everyone has been super understanding.
Lol, oddly enough my day was WAY more productive.  
EDIT: Lol, I definitely didn't realize what sub this was at first.
But from facebook mobile app Iam still able to Manage campaigns
Not only facebook but instagram too 🙄
I turn off mobile completely.
Google doesn't let you filter out mobile apps any more (they changed that a few months ago).
So much fraud on the mobile apps, apps just built for click fraud. Even worse, they'll fake convert just so they can get more ads to click fraud.
Yes, because of some mobile apps Google is struggling with clickfraud on its display network.
As for some suggestions, Yes, a lot comes down to data, but a strategist looks at logic, which is rhetorical math. I've been doing this for 4 years, and I graduated with a degree in philosophy. It helps break down the abstract/concrete and how they support each other, and how they differ. Everyone learns /what to think/ with a marketing degree.  You already know a lot of that, and if you don't go take FB Blueprint or whatever course. But in the real world, you need to learn /how to think/. You have good experience. But to me the time spent doing something is irrelevant (in most cases). 2 months managing 250k in ad spend for me may be more than 6 month of someone managing 25k. So stress the importance of the work you did.  This is all my opinion. I can't tell you anyone is right or wrong. I just know what works for me! Keep up the good work
PS I don’t work in the corporate world so I can’t speak for that, I run my own business, but that’s what I’d hire when it comes to hiring a digital marketing strategist
SEO and Content is not my area but Moz's Whiteboards are good for introduction!
Jade darmawangsa! Really like her 🙈
I hope your suggestions are good, because youtube became very shitty place for many topics everyone is just trying to get your money out of your pocket
You could try measureschool
There are a ton of free resources out there . If you really want to pay for something I'd suggest contacting someone who is an expert  and asking for a consultation or a 1 on 1 coaching session. Maybe record the session and make it available for the rest of your colleagues,that way you can justify buying a coaching session instead of a course.
There is no conference or course just for display advertising. That would be a topic in a couple or a session or two at a conference like HeroConf, SMX/ SMX Advanced or even BrightonSEO in the UK. You need to attend a conference that deals with PPC to meet people and the agenda might have something on display. At least going to the conference means you can network and chat with people are display.
Monthly - overall traffic from all sources
Monthly conversions - sales
Monthly on page & off page activity 
You can give important detail in excel sheet like keyword status, track the detail from Google analytic and take the screenshot in Win file, give the traffic status (Current month+previous month traffic) with the screenshot from analytic, Channel Traffic, Bounce Rate(%) and also New Visitors Vs Returning Visitors.
I usually run a monthly dashboard which is a spreadsheet which has traffic (separated by type) avg time on site, bounce rate, I also update monthly social channel stats, stats on email campiagns and then tie it in the bottom by reporting on conversions and sales. 
Weekly if I am running PPC it is spend and traffic, if not then just basic traffic vs. sales/conversions numbers without all the details. 
As for what data, top level is Users, on-site engagement metrics and e-commerce sales.  
Most of the industry operates off of this formula: media + management fee = budget
Some agencies have flat rates by platform, campaign, etc but are often smaller shops. 
You charge how much you need to survive. 
I recommended this before and it seemed to help a similar ask, helped me figure out pricing too. https://www.freshbooks.com/assets/other/Breaking-the-Time-Barrier.pdf
Monthly or hourly based are best way charge.. I will ask charges monthly for my clients and I will charge 30 to 40 percent of amount on which they would like to spend a month for digital marketing activity as services charges. 
We don't have any industry standard charges for digital marketing activity 
Flat fee works best for me, on a 6 month contract
No results. The client owes me nothing.
I have a monthly retainer or flat rate for single jobs. 
Personally I charge by the hour.
Retainer, ideally with a 6 month or year-long committment. Makes the headaches of the up's and down's of contracting so much more manageable when you're able to forecast your work.
 Charge what you think is your value. Don t let anyone define your value, except you.
Facebook blueprint (although, you’ll have to pay for the certificate test). 
Get the HubSpot certifications and the Google certifications. Many who are doing digital marketing don't bother with these courses so you have a head start. These are no substitute for experience but it will help you familiarize with the tools when you actually start working.
Uh yea just walk in a agency and deliver results.Forget all these credentials and resume crap.This is what I am going to do.To try and get a degree or “certificate” in social media and digital is preety useless and a waste of time.A agency is a dime a dozen don’t let them them make you believe anything different. At the end of the day they want experience or results so be sure to deliver 1 or another.I would much rather spend my time getting better certification or credentials in something more advanced and let all the knuckle heads get a degree in PR or marketing which is becoming more and more diluted.There is a huge misconception between having a track record and having a degree and I can tell you right now a track record is the new degree especially in digital advertising.
To graps the concept of digital marketing, the book Digital Marketing for Dummies by Russ Hennebery and Ryan Deiss covers a lot of the basic which is really important to start in this field.
You will learn about digital marketing funnel, tools, terms and concepts.
The Digital Marketing Certified Associate course from Market Motive... It's a long, but very very in depth course on many different avenues of digital marketing. There are video lectures, quizzes, worksheets to complete, and a real-world project. Probably the closest you can get to a college semester course on Digital Marketing. And it's mostly updated for 2018 as well.
Social media manager is a useless title. You’re a digital marketing manager. 
You’ve been underpaid since 2013. $27K is ridiculous for what you described. $50K is better but push for more. Don’t go into places saying you’ll work for $25 an hour because you shouldn’t be paid hourly at this point in your career. You’d still be underpaid at your ideal rate. 
Digital Marketing Manager. PPC is important, but not necessary for that title. 
You are certainly a digital marketer. A lot of focus on intergrated marketing as well. If you are designing, executing, and optimizing these campaigns then you should be charging a lot more. Just to give you a rough idea. Our social media coordinators make 45k as entry level and all they do is social. Our email marketers are paid 55-60k. Our content marketers are around 50-60k range. I focus more on high-level strategies, acquisitions, paid media, evergreen programs and I'm well near 6 figure range. Depending on your experience by years, you should be around 70k range minimum.
Very good question...Many times I also get confused with titles....
2. What has attracted to you to digital marketing, and how have you gone about learning and improving. I’m always impressed if candidates have their own freelance work, or help market their friends’ websites for the sake of learning - shows passion for digital, and is a better way to learn than being directly taught everything. 
I have only one more tip to add to previous answers - be calm and confident.
Go in and be honest about what you enjoy doing in digital marketing related to that job, and let them know what you’re eager to learn. Try to covey a specific skill you bring to the table that could make their lives easier and the agency more money. 
Be specific to having a passion for the type of work they do and don’t try to fake it. If you don’t know .... you want to learn.
Anything by Russell Brunson. I think he has one coming up soon in SD. 
Pubcon. They have 3 conferences each year in Florida, Austin, TX and Vegas.
Hubspot has quite a few certifications which'll fit your needs
EdX and Kaggle have some really great material to grow your experience with data. Not a ton in the digital marketing arena, but pretty robust data science and computer science stuff, which is helpful when working with datasets.
More experience on my resume is find a place you can volunteer at as a Marketing assistant or Social Media assistant. Depending on what industry you want to go In, understanding how to leverage social is huge and plus volunteer experience looks great on a resume 
You can do Bing Ads certification & Google Ads for free. They are renowned also.
It wouldn't hurt to have the certificate, but it isn't going to hold much weight either.  
Get the Google Adwords certification and Facebook Ads certification.  I care much more about what you can demonstrably do for me than I do about Vermont's Digital Marketing Fundametals Cert.  I've run into too many marketing degree entry level hires with no discernible skills, I don't put much weight into digital marketing education.
You can do anything if you have the skills to sell and deliver results.A certificate is just a plus but will it be impressive no.Ineiuld seriously get it howver
Any tips on how I could learn digital marketing from scratch?
I have a very detailed campaign for targeting home buyers. We aren't in the same market, shoot me a dm and I will send you over what is working for me.
Be careful how you target. I ran marketing for two real estate brokerages. Using zip codes is good but FB would often be pesky about targeting certan areas. 
Exclude people with the job title "Real estate broker or agent" if you don't want someone else to spam your ads comment section. Many older people tend to give their numbers on the comment itself, so actively monitor it and after noting it down delete it asap.  Not exactly  the tip you were asking for, but it will help you in any real estate related ads.
Digital marketing is such a broad term and the roles within each company vary immensely.  
Senior marketing director here ( 6 years) - typically 3 hours of work generate about one day of productivity so i spend the first 3 days of the week working (8 hours each day minus lunch)  and the rest of the week analyzing data so by the end of the week I am quiet ahead. Lot's of spreadsheets, content calendars and scrum meetings every morning. Productivity tools and actionable items help a lot. I believe in breaking the day into sprints with one 10 minute break every hour. It's really not about the quantity of hours worked but the quality of your work and how you can complete your tasks as effectively as possible. A lot of my habits i derived from playing chess where you wanna make your moves as economical yet as effective as possible so your positioning is always favorable by the end game.
I also have a tendency to take work home with me.
10 hours? Occasionally I get burnt out and “slack off” but even that just means I’m looking at stuff on social media or reading digital marketing articles.
Depend on work, as we are agency so it's compulsory to attain office regular, sometimes weekend too.
I work at a small agency. We haven’t been “slow” in over a year. So I’m working about 7.5 hours/day on average. I always have more work to do than I can get to in a day. But our company culture emphasizes work life balance, so if an employee is consistently putting in more than 40 hours/week there’s often a rebalancing of workloads (or generous bonuses/salary increases).
I am a digital marketing manager for over 80 hotels and I work 8 straight hours minimum 5 days a week.
Just finish the degree to avoid any future barriers. Also, it  supports that you're educated, able to finish a project to the end, well written, etc. Etc.
If you can't communicate why your Communications degree is a good thing, maybe you missed a key module.
Not worth it.
The job market changes all the time, what’s in demand now will not be in demand forever. A college degree will help you be more resilient to market changes. Done right, the experience will also help you grow as a person.
For context, in my company, I only hire people with degrees. It's not PC but there are some places that won't give you a chance without one. Get it over with.
My boss just got a job as a Communications Manager making like 6 figures (5 years experience) I think it’s worth it!
Having the degree will help you a lot in the long run - not getting it could be the worse decision you ever made.
\- Google Analytics: this allows you to see all conversions except facebook and Linkedin post-impression. It also allows you to deduplicate your facebook and linkedin conversions. The top conversion paths and model attribution comparison can help you, but it won't track when a facebook and linkedin ad impact only with impressions;
Another option is that you can get another phone number for them, use only that number in your ads so that they can see how many calls they get from ads.
Depends on where their customers hang out online, how customers would interact with an updated business's online presence, and what business problem the business wants solved. 
Sometimes businesses do ok with a crappy web presence because some other factor drives customers to the business. 
Google, FB or Yelp most likely depending on the audience and business. 
Same for any ad network. With that much spend (annually? monthly?) I’m sure you have direct contact with reps at every ad network. Some reps are better than others, but they all have the same goal: get you to spend more on their network. 
I'm going to take it in a slightly different direction. So feel free to disagree because it's not an optimization but an add-on.
Using long form customer testimonials as ad copy — even though best practices are to have short copy on FB ads I’ve literally had ads with 2 paragraphs of direct testimonials from customers that have gotten 3x higher ROAS than the same creative only shorter copy.
Lol, but for real I have a few because I’ve been spending massive amounts of time learning recently
I would say shoot for a cost you know is profitable. If you know you make money acquiring a customer for $75 then shoot for that.
Lifetime Value is a great metric, but something you should never guess at. I've seen folks lose substantial amounts of money because they fundamentally misunderstood the value of their customers.
I don’t think you should be spending $300 per signup yet, but on the flip side, if your paying customers are churning in less than 3 months I would solve that problem before pouring more gas on the fire.
Take your current CPO and set a goal CPO. Calculate the CPO on a Top Level and also on your different channels (adwords, facebook and others). Whilst optimizing your ads keep an eye on your CPO. We track this on a daily basis, especially if we have changes in running ads. If we see an upward trend we need to re-optimize. The longer your ads run the better they become and the algorithms can learn.  
Don't run in the dark, use the date you have.
Politics is a very controversial topic. I try to avoid them because it may deter other clients away who support opposing parties etc. Depends on where you live but in the country where I live no matter how much it pays I stay out of it.
I did a good one. Created a website like a form where you choose differents options and at the end I told you which one you should vote. It got viral 
Digital marketing for a political figure isn't really that far from digital marketing for your products. I mean, its like selling, but now your advertising for someone. So the basics still apply. 
I have helped a handful of candidates with digital marketing (website, social media, content strategy/automation, advertising, and video townhall with streaming). There are plenty of things that are similar, like u/smiley44 says but there are unique challenges. Candidates were harder to manage (scripts/talking points, etc.) than brands and the level of interaction is AMAZING with both supporters and random public who want to troll/fight/disparage/derail your communications.
Only two of these candidates spent money on polling but honestly the audience metrics were just as predictable. I like the pacing but the politics of it were a struggle. 
Just my $0.02.
One of the good tool for political figure must use it by using every platform to engage with public 
Follow the basic rules of Brand Marketing and treat the person as brand while doing marketing. It will help you to perform better. For example, I did some for myself in 2017 and yet the results are still there. If you open google and type Ravi Kumar Rana then you can find almost all of my profile link on first page of google and my blog which I recently set up in October, is ranking on 1st position. 
Get Google Ad Certified, and certification through FB and put that on your resume.  That course you’re taking would have no value to me an employer.  
I’m kind of putting together an agency. There might be some opportunities for you there. It might mostly be just to learn. I’m not sure. But thugs you’re able to do we could probably turn into work for you. 
Love that you’re learning. Try to do something with that knowledge in the short term, and claim a resume bullet point with it.
* In person sales at meetups, parent get-togethers, etc. Do something that doesn't scale, but that gives you access to amazing feedback early on. You can take videos and get testimonials at these events too and build up trust.
* Mommy bloggers! Make them affiliates too.
* Lastly, Facebook will be a good social network to advertise on.
I will say no blog is the best. I will give you my method. I learn something everyday related to business and make notes so that i can refer them later. Straight away search on google, this way you can learn a lot more than just reading one blog.
Stone temple for SEO....dudes are next level
Implement Google analytics, search for best practices lists for the below given topics, learn and implement
4. Paid social - Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Linkedin, Youtube
The brain dean backlinko
Courses are decent. But when you start working real time you learn so much more than no class can eber teach. Good luck. 
Learn the principles and backbone strategy on Youtube and various websites, but trial and error is the only way you will gain enough experience and skill to justify a price point that you can support yourself on. 
Intern at a digital marketing agency. We all can use the extra help!
You’re just not likely to find that sort of thing for a couple reasons —marketers don’t want to give away info to the competition and because they don’t want clients knowing what’s in the secret sauce. This is also why marketing and ad tech conferences are so lame. 
The best resources are the ones provided by the ad platforms themselves because they have a vested interest in your success ( they want to retain your media spends). Get certified in AdWords and Google Analytics. That’s where I’d start. 
My agency males their own but before I worked here there used to a a thing called "Google think" that had case studies you could DL and use.
Google VWO, they posted some of their results as "case studies" ... they don't show how they did it, rather just say that their methods work ...
Honestly, the same things that worked in late 2016 are going to determine rankings in 2017. The suspicions are:
5. This goes without saying, but mobile friendliness and targeting realistic keywords are super important.
Performing Off page SEO & On page SEO activities
I would say interaction is important in terms of ranking. It is often left aside. The focus is now mainly technical but we shouldnt forget about organic influence
4. use social media 
1. Make sure your site is mobile friendly, this year Google will be very strict on this so be sure on that as test your site if it is, most people think there site is mobile but the truth is they are not.so test it.
4. Meta description, that can help much don't forget them.
Great content, Proper link structure, Readability, User experience, etc.. is a good foundation to focus on.
These are examples of real, natural signals that any thriving business would have. 
Yes, but mainly because you are a small fish in a very competitive pond.  Trying to compete in Google Adwords for an SEO/Link Building business seems like it would be damn near impossible to compete with some of the bigger boys in that space.
From a more broad perspective, I see SEM becoming more of a commodity.  It seems it is more of a defensive play to avoid being conquested, as opposed to 10 year ago it was offensive.  
When I got into the business 10+ years ago I saw vendors charging ridiculous fee structures for Google Ad campaigns...  In some instances upwards of 40% of media.  Now it seems like a price war to the bottom, with 10-15% fees.  SEM is becoming a commodity.
Think of the intent of the searcher. What OTHER things do people search for that could lead them to wanting a link building service?
Think long tail keywords to content and make the sale on the retargeting.
Yes, it is because there are millions of online marketing services provider who are using Google ads. That's why there is a high competition to compete with the other service providers. The competition is higher than ever before because of some of the industry leaders, not just competitive with the massive amount of money but they also get the high adscore every time they put their ad on Google ads.
>CPC isn't cheap, but the ROI can be worth it. For example, over the past week for my account we have spent over 30k but with a ROI of 692%...  It's not easy, but it can be done.   
In the end we are all fucked :)
No, it’s not the end. Because business owners (b2c) want to run their business. That’s why they hire agencies to handle all digital 
Tell me if you know a client that will allow Google Ads to run their whole campaign and I'll leave this industry right now 
The cost of an employee to manage AdWords to the same level that an agency would, I believe would be more expensive. 
I’m high up in the digital marketing world, yet we still outsource our Google AdWords for our business for convenience. There is better areas I and the rest of my team could spend our time on 
There may be a small shift, but in the overall spectrum I do not think this will be a massive impact to digital marketing agencies bottom line 
Yes, agency margins on media will definitely continue to shrink.  However, there is still a serious need for many other digital marketing channels 
The main point of digital marketing is to drive traffic to a site so that they convert (sign ups or buys or engaging on site). 
Take one month free trial of digitalmarketer and try to learn as much as possible from the certifications courses. They have a lot of nice courses. 
Don’t forget to cancel your subscription as soon as you signup otherwise they will charge you when the month is over :) 
Find a mentor about Digital Marketing. Learn from him. Apply your learnings. Improve his ideas etc.
I have the same questions too. It seems the more research I did, the more confuse I became. 
And the list goes on and on. 
I should have just work hard at my day job, save my income and let it compound. At least there’s something to show 
Okay one of the BEST resources ever is [https://backlinko.com/hub/seo](https://backlinko.com/hub/seo). It's pretty much a free course that gives you all the nitty gritty on SEO, which is something you really need to know about unless you just have an endless marketing budget to do paid advertising. 
Just like u/sisimackles said, the whole point is to drive traffic to your site. You do that in a number of ways (as the guy in the little free course I linked will teach you), but one of the main ways to do it is by utilizing backlinks to build up your page authority. There's a super cool free tool I've been using lately called Respona, which uses A.I. to take all of the pain out of trying to outreach and get backlinked and all that jazz. 
I think they're still offering free early access on their site, if you wanna check it out. Getting backlinked is essential when you're trying to win at the Google SEO game. Hope this helped!
Check out Hootsuite to help manage the multiple social media channels.
\---- The steps I would use to bootstrap a basic social media presence ----
Then, Identify the social networks that your audience spends the most time on. Ambitious students have probably started using LinkedIn, most have Facebook and Instagram. 
I love discussing relevant and realistic strategies for starting the digital marketing journey! DM me if you want to discuss further!
Do facebook blue print certification
You can't do everything, take a step back and understand who your target audience is, and who it isn't. Focus on your idea customer/persona and build your strategy around them.
Do the Google academy courses, learn Analytics inside out. Get to grips with Google Ads. Learn the basics of a digital strategy. 
Open a Google Ads account and find a coupon online, send some traffic to your site, analyse its performs and generate a report of your findings. 
The content is all out there at your fingertips in one google search. 
A degree in marketing isn't required to work in marketing; however, most firms will ask that you do have a degree - whether it be in general business, finance, psychology, etc. 
Recommend online training:
eCornell Intergrated Marketing 360 Certificate
Then apply for internship.
Focus on getting a degree and angling for a good internship next. Yeah you can sling eBay affiliate bullshit on day 1 with no degree but do you think Fortune 500 brands and top digital agencies are hiring people with no degree? In fact, I’d say education is more important than experience when it comes to getting your first entry level career track job. 
These are must have skills to become digital marketer
* basic knowledge of marketing,
6. Social media marketing
Everything that was mentioned above plus Customer Relations. In my opinion none of the skills above are worth a damn if you can’t talk through it and have a strong pitch game. 
I have been working in digital marketing for the past 4 years and have solid knowledge of email marketing and a decent grasp of Google Analytics. I’d like to increase my skill. 
Image manipulation (Gimp is free) and video editing (VideoPad is free). Creating quality content is a great asset for your client's website, social media, email, print material, etc.
I offer event photography and videography with my services. For example, i filmed interviews with chefs at a food event.
 PATIENCE LOL. Honestly, a lot of tools require AB testing, things take time, you have to do your research, there are really no shortcuts until you really get it and can feed off your deep knowledge of the subject and hacks. And staying on trend - there's nothing worse than using dated tools or methods or lingo. Like, I'm honestly spending hours on slime accounts to learn about the methods they use, although probably 99&#37; of them learned everything they know from articles online and not formal education or anything like that. Sorry about the segway, just spent a bunch of time doing a blog on that
A bit of loaded question, especially as digital marketing has grown so much in last 5 or so years. However, to be a strong digital marketing generalist I think a mixture of different skills will lead to the highest level of success. 
First and foremost, a knowledge of marketing fundamentals is key. Digital marketing is still marketing just in specific channels. A good digital marketer should understand how there work fits into a broader marketing and business strategy. This allows them to not only ensure the work they are doing is aligned but also gives them the opportunity to enrich that strategy. 
Finally the ability to communicate your ideas and technology to none digital markets. This allows you to sell in your ideas to more senior members of a business and accelerate the digital growth for your business (also get help you get more money and resource ; ) ) 
The above is assuming you are looking at a digital marketing generalist role. There are many different channels in digital marketing (such as SEO, SEM, Social, eCRM, Websites, Display Advertising, Video Advertising, Ux, Data & Analytics, etc...) which all require different skills and knowledge. Usually you would have experts to support you on these topics.
Call (potential) customers/users, ask them who they are, what they dream about, what keeps them up at night, what their typical day looks like, what leads them to buy certain products, what influences their decision...
2. **Anticipate on these extremely valuable insights**  
They don't know how to do something? Write a blog post about it, turn it into a video, share it in communities where they are hanging out  
Also, don't stop learning from your clients (see: 1.). Keep calling/mailing them, asking them for feedback, giving them value...
Just my 5cents.
Here's the ONLY thing that matter as a digital marketer: 
If you have a cell phone, you have the same opportunities as anyone with 15 million followers. 
It's the only thing that matters. 
It has all the attention when it airs on TV. 
Because these events have all the attention, the prices for marketing during these events go UP. 
The only thing that has changed is the medium, the channels, the availability and the prices. 
It's the same thing. 
I'm nearing my mid 40s and don't think about it. As long as you provide value, you're worth it. But I agree with other poster, start a side hustle. 
As being one in the younger group I would say that any management that just replaces an older person with more experience with someone cheaper is a little retarded. As long as you keep learning and growing there won't ever be a need to replace you. You just have to be the guy who always knows better tips and tricks than the youngsters. I work with guys 30+ years older than me and I'm constantly trying to learn from their experience. 
I'm 22 and constantly panicking that they'll replace me with some part-time, unpaid college intern because that's how much my work is undervalued. 
Whats your role? What has your growth been in the last 5 years? What are your excel skills? Project management? How well do you understand the platforms that you work with?
If the former... You really should stay updated to the trends and tools to stay relevant.
I think it's a great plan, I'd love to propose that in the firm I work for, but I fear that all the work on putting together the videos will fall back on myself and my designer friend (on top of that, we overview everything that has to do with content: texts, graphics, even mailings). How are you approaching the workload of videos? Any tips to make it easier and faster? Good luck with the plan! 
Not an adpocalypse, it’s just a different form of advertising. It’s called social media advertising for a reason. The content tends to be social and inspire social engagement.
In my experience I’ve seen drastic changes from aligning ad content and social topics and using that optimization method. One of my clients their ad cost per order (gifting industry) is around $8 currently (avg unit cost around $80). Currently, this strategy is the primary source of our online business. They are hitting about 130 orders/mo. this way.
Oh, and I gotta add: Salesmen trying to cold-call link to me or send pitches on Linked In. Seriously? I only link to people I genuinely know and have worked with, but not a week goes by that I don't have one or two cold calls. I say this as I just got another from someone who's in "software solution sales" from a company I've never heard of.
Thanks for flagging, I'll do my best to keep up.
Just think of some honest questions, job interviews are a two way street you should make sure its the right company for you also.
Be really careful trying to use questions to 'wow' an interviewer, it has potential to backfire. 
Ask about ares that matter to you, what are the specific areas that interest you about SEO and ask how the role will involve these aspects.
Ask about career progression, training, what is the team like etc.
Its a very common question asked to SEO person that why you want to work in SEO 
3>Your before knowledge in digital marketing
Make whoever you're talking to feel like they would be really fucking up if they didn't pass the info on to someone higher up.
Talk about what others are doing or even their competitors if you can do the research. Go to them with facts, not speculation.
If possible make presentations with after effects and leave the link with your business card.
Trim the data to the essentials: lead generation, SEO, CPC, CRO etc. 
I’d also love really like to know the answers to these questions :)
If all those twitter clicks bounced/had very short time on page they may not have been counted by GA.
Honestly if you can't make remarketing profitable with it don't waste your time.
Of which social is: 13   
Also, some clicks sourced from social media platforms like TW and FB get counted under Referrals and Direct in GA.  
That's a very broad question with not too much context. Marketing Strategy has multiple layers, look up the "P's of marketing" for one. You should find some entry level marketing strategy concepts from there.
Most of my business revenue comes from my specialty SEO, and web design because that is my specialty. I only do strategy consulting if I know it's within my expertise.
If you are purely just now diving into digital marketing with almost no experience, I would encourage you to try free courses to get comfortable with all things marketing to start talking the language by the time April hits.
>Bonus; whats it like starting fresh with Digital Marketing and how can I work to the best of my abilities whilst being unqualified and completely new to it all?
just do it.  watch 400 youtube video...pick a niche and sell...
Start working on getting AdWords certification. You’ll learn all the basic digital marketing concepts and if you show up to work on day 1 already certified your boss should be impressed. Not that certification is the be all end all but it’s a good way to learn the UI inside out. 
What you want to do in Social media management? 
I would like to do basic tasks. Manage and schedule posts, content.  Nothing crazy, just a tool to provide clients. 
Different tools.
Have you tried Later? I’ve used Hootsuite and I personally prefer Later, but it depends on what you’re looking to do. 
I prefer both Hoofer and Buffsuite, tbh. 
Buffer always - hootsuite causes me more bother than it's worth
I personally prefer Buffer, though Hootsuite offers many features not available in Buffer.
Buffer is more geared towards social scheduling, but I like it and have been using it for years. They have a free version which is good, but it's also pretty affordable if you need to upgrade. 
But Socialaider not provide analytics report... Right now it's work on FB pages, twitter, Instagram and tubler .. 
They are different. But my vote goes to Hootsuite.
Hootsuite and Buffer are so similar, yet they are so different too.
Two major factors that will help us decide which one comes out on top are;
Good ole calendar I made in publisher 🤣
google cal and a notebook (no I'm not in my 60s... :P)
Co- schedule for social media content, to send out content automatically. ( convenient since IG and twitter doesn’t have scheduling function for organic content) 
I highly recommend using Hootsuite! It’s easy/simple to use and can combine all your social platforms into one place.
Hi from a dinosaur! I use notebook for big daily cases and phone notes for shop lists and so on. 
Perpetual traffic is really good for digital marketing
Foundr is good. 
I listen to perpetual traffic, marketing over coffee, social media examiner and the art of paid traffic are my favorite
I tend to use 15-20 hashtags, but I rotate them. So I’ll actually have 60 hashtags in my bank and then rotate every day so that Instagram doesn’t think my profiles are spam.
Also, there is Tailwind Instagram Hashtag Finder, with this you do not need to put dozens of hashtags. It is a complete Hashtag tool.
hashtagify.me is a good place to start
Digital marketing is very broad.
Have you even started your PhD yet? You will spend at least your first year coming up with a topic. Reddit is not the place to ask.
I would somehow create a connection with the cognitive economy (I'm nota shure about the name. In italian is "economia cognitiva" it is like psicology applied to the economy
Google and amazon are unchecked monopolies that drive absolutely massive consumer behavior decisions. Furthermore, they allow cheating, and false reviews on a giant scale allowing individuals and businesses to falsely manipulate consumers into making improper buying decisions. 
"The extreme influence of the Google company to the digital world - What would happen, if the whole Google company would close today" (Search, Youtube, Adsense, AdWords, Android, etc.). For example how many youtubers would lose their only income, etc.
Look up Google's Digital Garage. YouTube, Udemy, Udacity, edX, Coursera, Lynda, etc are all good resources as well.
Also YouTube is a glorious place to learn!
But the killer gap then comes in the 'entrepreneurship' and business skills to build a business, systems and clients.
Decide which channels you would like to pursue, and get into the more advanced stuff regarding of your choice. Contact local businesses and do some free digital marketing for a start, in advance of them giving you a review/case that can be used for getting $ clients to your business.
Honestly, the skills aren't that difficult to learn. But you probably want to learn how to SELL those skills to PAYING clients..
Let me know. 
Happy to help, hit me up if you're up to. I'm in digital marketing for quite a time already :)
OP, would love to see your post/interview when complete. :) feel free to reach out if you need more digital marketers to interview. 
I think using Facebook is a very good idea as it has very cheap prices and in under developed countries everyone who has internet connection uses Facebook
In developing country, you can do SMS marketing to farmers and SEO, SEM and e-mail marketing for niche customers.
Ask your users, they are your best source of feedback in this situation especially because you have a decent level of engagement already - you can literally dm them and ask them for advice. Reach out to some of your power users and ask if you can setup a 15 minute Skype session, don't be afraid to straight up ask them why they haven't bought anything. Do a survey on your site or via your mailing list and take all the money you would have sunk into ads and spend it on incentives for people to take your survey. The problem could be anything so don't make assumptions about what the issue is (someone is probably going to suggest that it's pricing but that's not necessarily true). 
My guess is that everything isn’t actually designed perfectly like you said.. maybe the offer isn’t right, the price is off, you aren’t reaching the right people, etc.. or you would definitely have more sales by now.
I don't think your pricing is bad. I've spent $10 - 20 dollars myself. So here are some suggestions from my end. I handle from top to bottom strategies at work but it's a whole different industry.
* This is a small chance but is your product being pirated? There's not much you can stop it but you can make it more difficult for users to easily find them by reporting it to be taken down if you see it.
* Do some sales campaign. Create promo codes for discounts and more. You can do a survey and ask your customers to do a survey for a 50% discount.
I hope this helps!
Having sufficient traffic doesn't entail an increase in sales, unless you have a thorough marketing strategy for sales.
Do you know who are your potential clients? maybe they are not among those people who visit your website through your instagram page.
It would be more efficient if you have some marketing consultant analyze your website and social media pages to find out the bugs in your marketing plan. However, if you want to do it yourself and do not have a budget for hiring a consultant, you can do it yourself by taking marketing courses, you need to get a good grasp of all aspects of marketing from the Product to Price, Place and Promotion... the 4 P's of marketing and how they impact your sales.
 $500 on Adwords Ads - Same idea. "Batman Showing at ____ Theatres Now." Target keyword searches for the specific movie, theatre, and searches for movies in the area. 
Week 1 15% $150
Week 3 30% $300
4. Don't ignore Bing, Split you SEM budget into 30% Bing, and 70% Google as this is current distribution between their search traffic. Bing CPC is much cheaper than Adwords. I've put my reference about this below.
7. Apply growth hacks. Create a microsite for a movie playing in the cinema (www.BatmanReturnsatCinemaName.com).  Using a referral program ask people to refer a friend to the film to win a free ticket and popcorn. People who successfully refer three people, get a free ticket. 
If this serves as your part of your interview, having an understanding of that is VERY important.  Movies typically start strong and fall in numbers.  Choosing an up and coming film creates more time.  A rushed campaign is a bad campaign.  
Your ad should promote the customer experience of your actual theater.  Just saying "Come here, we are showing this movie you hopefully want to see" is not enough, especially on a $1000 budget.  You don't think your friendly megaplex competitor isn't doing that with a bigger budget? Invest in the experience.  Use your social media to create sharable content.  Dress as the characters and upload the picture with our hashtag.  We will pick one to be on the site.  Pizza party before the show.  You must figure out what you must do to bring butts through the door, and you can't do that unless you figure out what will get those butts into the car.  We target mothers for kids movies because they are they ones who generally watch the kids.  We target Snapchat and GeoTags and Search Users Nearby because thats the app teens are using every single hour they are awake.  By creating the user experience that's exclusive to your place of employment, you have a foundation of what you are going to place in the other channels such as your website, social media, etc.
If you don't know why, you probably don't know anything about the Amazon Affiliate Program. 
My opinion? I need solutions, needs met, problems solved, not tools. Try some content that does that :)
I just got a job in digital marketing having only taken 5 marketing classes. I am the first digital marketer for a healthcare clinic. I do not think that opportunities are running out. If anything they are increasing. As for training, I do have a degree in communication. You can do things on your own like getting certified in Google AdWords.
It's never too late.
I still can't fathom why anyone who is skilled enough to run good campaigns doesn't jump to affiliate marketing and  just work for themselves.
Never too late. Land an interview for an entry level job and prove your work ethic. You'll learn everything along the way. I've hired folks with no experience compared to those with tons. You can't teach work ethic and unfortunately this business is filled with way too many entitled and lazy folks who don't care to learn or stay late to be team players.
If you really ineterested in  digital marketing industry, it's never to late. And you don't need to take a university course to become an expert, actually.  But if you want it because of ease and popularity you may be disappointed in the process of studying/working
It’s never too late, if anything now is a great time to get into digital. But it’s far from easy!
It's never too late to do anything... unless you're trying to enter a kids talent show at age 40
It's absolutely not too late!
In fact, it's the perfect time. There has never been an easier time to get online and break into the digital space.
Sure, there's more competition than there was 5 years ago, but with the right attitude and hard work you can soar above the rest because they don't have the drive.
I myself started digital marketing 2 years ago after locking myself away from the world for almost a decade.
I now earn 5 figures a month from affiliate marketing and have traveled the world speaking on stage about my transformation. 
It's never too late! :)
Tons of businesses out there without any competent marketing departments.
Too late? No this is the beginning  Google has only been round since  1996 and Facebook since 2004. Digital marketing is at an early stage although it moves extremely quickly with new and more advanced tools being introduced on a seemingly daily basis. In fact it moves so quickly that small businesses cant keep up. Added to that things like SEO, SSL certificates GDPR, Facebook pixels are all things that in allot of cases are being overlooked and opportunities within this niche.
Please note that nothing is easy, you have to work hard and put your best efforts. Once you become proficient in your any field you will get ample of good opportunities.
Well, you have two options.
First, if you take an entry level position at an agency or company, culturing a natural relationship with an experienced digital marketer you respect is ideal (and that person respects you back as well). Just like any industry. 
As a digital marketer, you will need to acquire a set of skills and combine them to deliver results.
Udemy is so helpful, as a digital marketer, you are constantly learning and growing. Udemy is how I keep up even as a pro!
The same to me. I am waiting for someone who will giving the best for you and me. Hope that!
Watching 400 Youtube videos to try to figure out wtf I was doing.
Getting Admin access to all platforms that I will be handling. Going inside of the platforms to learn the current strategies they're using. Study the analytics data to learn where you are acquiring leads and traffic. See what's working, and what isn't. Start putting together a plan on what changes should be made, and why. 
First day was pretty much all admin (paper work, setting up computer, meeting co-workers and learning about the different teams and how they work together). After all that it was training on the systems/platforms used and shadowing colleagues to see what they did and how they did it. 
I probably got my first assignment during my second week and it was replicating a report that from a month prior with updated data. From there things started to build up but first day and week were more geared to admin and training.
Update information from webs which bring the value to apply for my work \^\^ 
There's also a few shady ways using linkedin, fake accounts, email lists and social.
Happy to get in depth - pm me if you wanna run down.
In my previous agency, I had only b2b clients. Several of them used social media. LinkedIn is an effective platform, not necessarily Facebook. Here's an approach that I found to work:
3. LinkedIn talks more about your business expertise, thought leadership, and service/product.
Here's where Facebook trumps linkedin. You can make a custom audience based on people who engaged with your previously sponsored post. Those guys and their lookalike audiences are more likely to pay attention to your next in line post
I've worked on a lot of B2C and B2B, for everyone from startups to supermajors. It totally works for both, and importantly \*can\* work on any platform, if approached correctly (For example, you can do B2B industrial lubricant sales on Instagram if you really want to, but it requires a bit of thought!).   
Feel free to PM me if you want, I can give you some specific examples. 
Useful concept for B2B:
Is LinkedIn social media? 
On the other hand, a small business owner might find a SaaS company advertising on Instagram/Facebook during leisure, that solves the pain points they’ve been struggling with. 
Yes - social media works for B2B marketing if the problem solver understands who they’re trying to reach and how they can reach them. 
Hello dear fellow, I'm a digital marketing coach from Tunisia and I think I can help you with that. 
Digital marketing is constantly changing and sometimes it can be hard to stay current on algorithm changes and trends when you're busy. Find a way to incorporate at least a small amount of digital marketing news as a weekly or daily habit.
If you are working this much, I would look for another job as this company does not respect your time if they want you to work 60 - 80 hours/ week. That is unhealthy.  If you are doing this on your own, I would cut back as you will burn out and that's not going to be pretty. If you want more hands-on time, see if a local nonprofit can use your skills for free on the side and work a normal 40 hour week.
What are you doing for 60-80 hours a week that isnt your goal career? That's not healthy in the slightest. 
Many people seem to have this idea that working lots of hours means you're a hard worker. It doesn't, it means thatveither you're not working efficiently or yoir company is taking advantage of you. You are not a surgeon (I'm guessing), no one is going to die if you put in less hours. 
Why don't you learn "on job" ? I know learning on job is tough, but i think you can work it out. As i can see you're spending 60 to 80 hours a week in an organization, i see it as an opportunity. Opportunity to learn, when you do not have work, then open up Udemy buy a course and listen 30 to 40 mins each day.
If you have no time, how can you develop? 
Digital Marketing is the overarching term that refers to any marketing efforts done online. This can include SEO, paid facebook, paid search, content marketing, conversion rate optimization, and many many more
While ALL SEO is digital marketing, not all digital marketing is SEO.
No, SEO is a major part of Digital Marketing. Without SEO digital marketing is incomplete. 
What is your industry and budget? 
Digital marketing = (seo, smm, ppc google ads, social media marketing facebook, Pinterest, twitter, reddit, tumblr,qoura, etc
 **Difference between SEO and Digital Marketing. SEO is one tool of digital Marketing** 
Some  of the methods used to earn money online and make your brand's online existence are:
Hope it helps!
 There are various methods in digital marketing. SEO is one such method which comes under digital marketing. Other methods include:
· Search engine marketing (SEM)
· Social media marketing
· Social media optimization
· e-mail marketing
SEO is a part of Digital Marketing. As you know Digital Marketing is a wide subject which includes SEO, PPC, SMM, Email Marketing
SEO is one tool of Digital Marketing. An SEO specialist is someone who has expertise, knowledge, and experience to optimize a site so that the traffic is increased and ultimately, ROI of the company.
Apart from this, there are other Marketing terminology
I would add an in-house Graphic Designer if you really want to do it right... People don't read anymore.  Ads we run with images convert 3x higher and 7x higher with a Graphic Designer on the team.  
In house is salary + media + learning curve
We routinely clean up the mess of in house teams more than agency screw ups. Unless you hire gurus, which are expensive, you won't even know if what they're doing is successful or a failure.
2x DM Specialists to look after implementation, optimisation and analyses would be my general suggestion. When you grow, look into hiring an analyst(s). You most likely do not need them straight away. If you do, hire one on a project / freelance basis.
Why don’t you try short term free lance specialists. I’ve worked at places where they ditched suppliers and used a single freelancer for a specialist role such as PPC. However there was still a main headcount for overseeing the organisations strategy. Depends on budget really. 
If you really need to build a team, I’d suggest a senior digital exec / specialist who looks after a super enthusiastic graduate who can carry out the paid acquisition activity. You may be able to borrow a data analyst from another department to analyse results and get graphic assets created from a marketing team? 
Sounds like a recipe for disaster if you’re not even sure who to even hire. You should be hiring based on needs within a strategy.
Do you need to produce more creative to reach additional audiences with segmented messaging or designs? Do you need copywriting to expand campaigns to compete with competitors? Are you paying too high a CPA because the campaigns are not properly filtering out overly expensive conversions on branded campaigns?
Let me know if you’d like to do an audit with us. We turn most around in 24 hours. (Depending on how robust your campaigns are.)
Do experiments as much as you want . And try to make profit from it !
My #1 golden nugget - 
Once people opt into that lightbox throw them into an automated email campaign telling them that they must convert w/ their "unique" coupon code before 1-2 days. Send 2-3 emails before the deadline and embed a countdown within each email to the deadline.
Have introduced this at every company I've been at w/ sufficient success. You don't even need to make each coupon code unique but just generate 8 random characters for it and call it a day.
Always ALWAYS know what's happening in the industry and your niche. Do your research before putting out anything. 
Find new ways to do the same old things. There are always new ways, look for them. 
Always test against your/ your team's assumptions but don't get overly lost in minor % difference's until your splashing out millions a month.  
Another good one but much more general marketing is don't forget its humans you are marketing to.
Don't get stuck in just learning...actually implement.

I would suggest a Udemy course. They always have discounts going on so you can usually find a cheap course that covers instagram marketing
Awesome article. I like the idea of being a farmer and not a hunter. This could apply to many digital marketing agencies.
I’m traveling through Europe as a full-time freelancer right now. Just need to be able to find pockets of cell-service & WiFi. 
Hey! Exciting plans! I have done this before -- traveled for 14 months in South America and just recently, traveled for a few months in Asia. To be able to sustain this travel lifestyle, I did freelance work. Most of my work assignments revolve around digital marketing and content marketing. And all of my clients I've acquired online, no need for a face-to-face meeting.
To be honest, it was hard for me to travel and work at the same time. Finding the time to do both was challenging for me but if you have the discipline and a strict work schedule, then it should work out just fine. Also, plan your travels ahead of time because once you start, you will always be on the move. You have to plan ahead because you need to take into consideration the travel time and internet connection reliability to every place that you'll go to.
Beyond what's been mentioned I would check out Lynda.com and Coursera. Great places for courses to learn more. 
\- Do some specific Google analytics & PPC certifications
I’m currently doing the Udacity digital marketing nanodegree which is an all round course and gives you experience in running fb campaigns and the foundations. This costs about £800. Also did the google digital garage, adwords and analytics which are free and fb blueprint exams are cheaper. Also just read blogs like moz, HubSpot.
Anyway, I wish you the best and if there is anything I can do to help, send me a message. I promise I won’t spam a link. I really do enjoy connecting  to other marketers. :)
[Today I spent too much time looking over the MarTech 5000 Supergraphic.](https://chiefmartec.com/2018/04/marketing-technology-landscape-supergraphic-2018/)
I come in the mornings have a few things to look over and make sure no fires started. 
- social media properties 
Really these are just for peace of mind and to see if I can find any opportunities to capitalize on. 
I usually leave mundane tasks to the end of the day like: 
social media posts, ya ... social media posts specifically. 
I also like to make sure I stay up-to-date with anything new that is developing within the space. It's a lot of fiddling with things and thinking of new and creative solutions to the same problem. 
Entry level ad ops for an in-house team. I work 10-6 pretty much. 
10 am-11: Settle in, check and answer emails, lay out my to-do list for the day. Our other offices are mostly in Europe 5-7 hours ahead, so I usually have a bunch in my inbox to look forward to. 
11 am- 12:30 pm: I usually have a catch up, meeting or conference call with coworkers in international offices during this time. If not, work on whatever is on my to-do list for the day. 
12:30 - 1:30: Pick up lunch. If it's nice out, eat outside. It's still pretty cold in NYC so I eat at my desk but I dont really work. This is me time. 
1:30 - EOD: This is when I actually mostly perform my job duties. Work on various recurring or ad-hoc reports, reply to emails, trafficking, check DBM campaigns to ensure no flights ending/overspending/problems with creatives. Always somehow have a meeting depending on day- it's important to keep track and follow up on meeting notes and optimization recommendations. 
Feel free to ask me anything. I have a pretty laid back job compared to others in this field and it might not be as typical as someone working at an agency but i'm happy to help either way. 
As a Digital Marketing newbie (working for 2 months in that company so far), my day consists of:
And yeah, that is pretty much it for now... I have just gotten a new client that I will be taking charge on my own, so there's also that, but don't know much about it so far!
i have to work nearly 12-14 hours a day for best result in digital marketing 
Awesome! Thank you so much for Sharing. So nice to see people take time out of their day to help others grow their business. Much love 
Starting video marketing we should have to builds trust and brand awareness, engaging audience, increase return on investment, improve search engine rankings, makes ads more effective.
Is Wistia really worth paying for over youtube? Anyone have personal experience?
I didn't know what I wanted to do either, so I started with what the "hot" thing was at the time (SEO) and I spent several years trying to be the best I could at it. There was a point when I coould claim 7/10 of the front page spots for targeted keywords and my biggest selling point was telling new client (always met face to face) that I'd have them on the front page before they got back to their office. (The trick was me working ahead of time to get a site ranked, and then updating that site with the client's info). 
That led me to my fascination with the strategy behind a more complex marketing approach and down the rabbit hole I went learning about sales funnels, conversion rates, and trying together campaigns like email, PPC, SEO, social media, etc.
Years? Yes - any one if these areas is just too complex to learn and master in a few months (probably a stretch to say you can master them in just a few years) but you will need that time to learn the different aspects of each focus.
Book recommendations would be:
(These will not teach you how to be a digital marketer, but they have significantly helped me throughout my career and I would highly encourage picking them up)
*This book taught me a great deal about patience, persistence, and gave me some of the tools that I still use today to help guide me on choices that we all have to eventually make about the quality of our own work and the value that we bring to others.*
*Until reading this book, I would have argued to the grave that bad publicity is a bad thing. It was a fun read that helped me understand to look for the winning angle with the cards / situation that you have to work with.*
*Hands down, this is one of those books that will change your life (if you take the time to not just read it, but continually practice some of the techniques it talks about). I've purchased this book about a dozen times, as I'm constantly giving my copy away when I meet someone that has not yet read it.*
*This book did change my life - and in a very significant way after I read it the first time. Now it's something that I try to read at least once every year to remind myself of some of the incredible perspective that it offers (this book taught me to pay attention to all the habits that exist in my life that, like most of us, I didn't exactly choose but are a significant part of my life anyway). Recognizing how many of us make these small decisions that are counter-productive to the career or life that we really want is beyond helpful, it's a real-world guide to getting your act together so that each morning you wake up living the life that you actually dream about.*
*I think a lot about stuff - and I enjoy doing it. This book helped me understand more about the process of thinking, and that there are many ways to leverage the process of thought to get people to do what you want them to.*
*Still to this day I get grief about recommending this book as often as I do, but it was paramount in helping me understand the true nature of what I now call 'the daily hustle'. It's a fast and simple read that will show you the value of having more than one source of income in your life.*
*At times I'm reading more than one book, so it's possible that when I first picked this one up I was simply too involved with whatever else I was reading that the book got put back on my shelf where it sat for almost a year. Once I finally got around to picking it up again, I had no problems reading through it and found myself wishing I had taken the time to read through it before.*
I can still remember the first video that introduced me to Russell, and I hated him right off the bat. Maybe it was because I happened to catch the video of him driving his Ferrari to work (and was outside in the video chuckling as it began to rain with his top still down). I jumped to conclusions and thought he was a douche - but somehow I ended up with his book, and then one of his other books, and then it was like a learning free-fall with how much this guy has figured out about sales funnels and conversion hacks. I would highly recommend learning whatever you can from him, it'll help no matter what niche you get into with digital marketing. 
I'm sure that I could keep going, but now you have at least some of the tools that I've come across and found valuable throughout my career. Take advantage of the blogs since they're free - and if you can spare the money spend the $38/month to be a paying member of DigitalMarketer where you'll find a boatload of tutorials that take you step by step through a lot of the stuff you might find you have to do as a digital marketer.
If you have any specific questions for me - shoot me a message. I'm happy to help.
For a total beginner, find out what you want to do in the digital marketing realm.  That book will explain to you what digital marketing is defined as, but it will not train you in any specific skillset, it will give you the knowledge to know what you're talking about and how it works towards a marketing team.
I'm sorry, if it's in a book, it's probably mostly outdated, with the exception of the core marketing principals that apply to any marketing.
I would say that there is no textbook that can teach you digital marketing because its evolving on a very fast pace, and as a beginner the best you can gain is only by sitting on the internet and reading more and more blogs and then experimenting the same on the practical  front because there is no knowledge gained if not tried and tested 
Look up influencer marketing if you want to check out Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube for business. 
I have to say that reading about your serendipity is slightly frustrating, as I've been on the hunt for 6 months for a position you landed on accident.
I totally second the other three posters. However, the one big piece I have to add is don't let it overwhelm you. There are a lot of areas to spend time and a lot of tools to learn. State the scope of the positition, rank the importance of strategies and tools you need to learn, and work on one at a time until fluency. Making a definitive list will show you it's not impossible. You'll get it -just don't let it overwhelm you.
I was in the same boat just under a month ago (I still am, but persevere, you'd be surprised at how much sinks in!) 
 and this SEO glossary is super helpful http://www.ricemedia.co.uk/blog/seo-glossary-common-seo-terms-explained/
Don’t get me wrong I neglect my own SM presence because I do it for work, but I do still have all of them so I can better understand what’s going on from a user perspective.
Nah bro unless you’re an influencer
Most are saying No but let me be devil's advocate. I do look at social media presence but not how you think. I see it as extended learning. Show me you leverage tools like social to study the competiton/industry, understand trends, best practices, breaking news, rumor reports, etc
See,Its not compulsion that you have to make social media presence to get job in digital marketing,as in digital marketing there are many channels like SEO,PPC,Email marketing,SMM ,you have to decide first in which channel you want to be expert. but yes it will increase you experience to work in digital marketing,as digital marketer should be updated in all such sites which gives new trends every day to work in this industry.
Nope not at all. I use social media for work but not really personally. They don’t care about that. You can learn trends at any time
I must say you should have an understanding of the social media and how it's works. trust me it's not tough. keep an eye on each social media channel and understand how marketing works there. Good luck
For example, I need my advertisers to be smart and witty, not only knowing tools and understanding data. They have to work with graphic design teams, write copy for ads tailored to specific channel. So I looked around their social media accounts a little bit before making a decision. 
You need at least 5K followers on each platform to get remotely close to landing a job in DM. Good luck my friend.
I am not sure why digital marketers need to know html and css since there is WordPress and/or other alternatives.
That said, i wouldn't bother with web development since 35% of the internet \[websites\] runs on WordPress.
Its like Centres in the NBA... typically you dont need to and are not expected to shoot 3 pointers....but what if you can?
This question is too vague to really answer. OP define what you mean by “digital marketing”
If digital marketing to you means strategy (planning) and the “doing” of things (seo strat and execution, building emails, building sites, building display ad units) then yes - you’ll need various levels of coding. 
That’s why you’re seeing conflicting answers to your question.
Edit: cleaned up my formatting a bit.
Pretty much anyone in Digital Marketing needs to know basic HTML/CSS, no way around that. Javascript is a nice to have but you can copy+paste most stuff once you know a bit about it.
You do not need to know ANY coding. 
It might be beneficial at times, but it’s not a barrier anymore. 
With software like Wordpress anyone can launch a website in minutes without touching a line of code. 
Is it mandatory? No--but put yourself in the client's shoes. Who are you more likely to sign a large contract with? The digital agency that also understands the foundation of the web, how websites are coded, and how to extract actionable metrics from how people interact with your website for your digital ad campaigns? 
These are the people that I constantly win business from because their sites fall apart, look like shit, are too slow, get broken, are poorly designed, not responsive, not customer-focused and ultimately cost them more in the long run.
Knowing how to setup GTM, and to get proper nuanced data from campaigns from a fast landing page is paramount in digital marketing. Knowing the underlying code for these things will make you a better digital marketer. Period.
There is no need to learn too deep coding for the digital marketers. But they should have the basic knowledge of CSS and HTML.  On the other hand, if they have the JS knowledge then it will also be a plus point for them.
The it degree might help you figure out some trick stuff in digital marketing... But generally have nothing to do with digital marketing... But if you're out on your own he might figure out some ways to use those skills to get a leg-up or figure out some software that helps you automate something that makes more money while arbitraging.
Let me give you the advice I wish I had gotten: FINISH YOU DEGREE no matter what.  A degree is a giant checkbox that needs to be ticked by the brainless morons that fill so many HR departments.  While you may be thinking now you want to be a business owner for the rest of your life, having a degree will make it so much easier if you ever do want to go get a job somewhere else.  
...And don't bother with an MBA.  They are on their way out...I don't honestly know why anyone gets MBAs anymore or even hires these people.  Most successful people I know hate working with MBAs because they basically have two tools in their belt:  cutting costs, and outsourcing.  MBAs destroy companies.  If you ever do decide to go for masters, take a few extra classes and switch to a Masters in Marketing, not a Marketing MBA.
Lastly, having a degree in IT will make you a perfect candidate to do marketing for the IT industry.  The highest paid marketers are extremely niche-focused and have strong backgrounds within their niche.  I'd rather hire someone with an IT degree who learned digital marketing on the side, than a person with a marketing degree who knows nothing about IT.  
Personally, I'm on the side of any "Self Made Digital Marketing Guru" is full of shit, and they are the biggest problem with the digital marketing industry right now. Most of these guys build libraries of courses/classes/videos/etc. and give away a lot of 101 level knowledge for free, then charge you for more info. But that "more info" never really comes. 
Their entire business model is not built on being digital marketing gurus - it's selling their courses to new people in the industry. Hell, many of these (like dropshipping courses) end with the guy telling you to start your own courses, and around we go. (I guess in that vein, they are good at what they do). 
If you really want to learn more about digital marketing and make a career out of it, I'd start with the basic resources online, including content from the platforms themselves (Google, Facebook, etc.). 
I was in a similar position two years ago, no experience, but I really wanted to try out digital marketing. I did one and a half unpaid internships. They were pretty easy to find in my area. Then from there I sat down one day and applied/sent emails to every local marketing agency that I could find, even if they didn’t have job openings posted. A small one contacted me a month later and hired me. I learned so much there and made amazing connections that have helped propel me. I’d recommend trying something similar before going straight into freelance work by yourself. Learning on the job from people with more experience is just so much more valuable than a paid online course in my opinion. 
Lynda.com. Aim for getting a full time job ASAP. Then pay for better and better courses, from reputable providers like Udacity. 
Are you prepared to cover an angry client's overspend when you screw up and go 3x over their budget? This happens with even experienced marketers. What happens when they start asking you slightly more than basic questions about what is happening or what else they can do and you stutter on the call and they realize you don't know wtf you're doing? 
The dream isn't dead but it isn't easy. You need big-fish clients that are going to see through an amateur and never give them a chance. You won't be able to do it with clients paying you $400 a month. At that point you might as well work at a company and get the perks that come with it as well.
The only time people share their secrets is when they get something out of it, which usually means they want to sell you something.
If it’s just normal stuff like “how do I install a tracking pixel” or “how do I make a landing page” etc then it could work I guess, but that information is also easily available on Google.
Sorry I don’t mean to burst your bubble, but I’ve seen a few of these ideas come and go without working out as expected.
Depends. If I'm looking for a quick tip for some thing I'm somewhat familiar with I'll do a few Google searches until I find something I feel was helpful. If it's a more advanced topic or if I couldn't find the answer to what I was looking for originally ill check Udemy and then maybe Lynda.
Im not necessarily active on online communities as I prefer to study online courses or books, but this is something I'm looking to change. I definitely see the value in this kind of interaction but most of the time I'll like an answer now and will use this community to answer questions I can't find answers to else where or just to learn how others approach certain aspects of digital marketing.  Its hard to tell how helpful this will be to my career but I can for sure see it being helpful to some degree.
In regards to Digital marketing I'm part of a few communities from some Udemy courses I purchased but I rarely check them. I do however check my web Development communities as I have an interest in the subject and I also attend wordcamp every year. I also check stack overflow of course.
Seems like all the money is in being a "guru" and selling courses. 
I agree with all  who gave valuable suggestions regarding the same but I personally believe find the piece that you really love and you want to do for the whole life. I Personally belive you have money in every domain every field, every industry.
Just check for yourself which industry you think there are no GURU's. Which doesn't make money.
There’s the technical aspect, where you specialise in the technical/operational aspect of DM; eg on-site SEO, coding, web development, executing media buy/PPC etc people within this career track end up as more technical performance specialists. 
There’s also the strategy aspect of DM, where people specialise in overall strategy planning, such as campaigns to run, which media channels to buy, which influencers to engage etc. People here usually end up as strat planners/head of strategy.
Look at threads where people have asked similar questions and find the most comprehensive answers with the most upvotes. 
What's your current role and goal?
Broadly? Omni channel is the future. There are a half dozen major channels that could draw your attention: Email, Search, Social, Display, Video and Native that could draw your attention and dozens of tactics and campaign types within each of those. 
As a marketer, I would suggest you dabble at all of them but specialize in only one. Because it is hardly realistic to become an expert in all of them. And also micro is the new thing. 
It depends on the role and level of activity / time required etc.
Each channel is unique and has many different aspects. The channels are constantly changing and evolving. There are new channels coming up every few months. So it's physically impossible to stay on top of every channel and become an expert. 
Having said that, you should try to become really good at more than one channel. I am recommending this for two reasons 
* It makes you more valuable and less likely to become obsolete if the channel goes down in popularity 
Let me illustrate with an example. Think about someone who focused only on Twitter 3 years ago when it was near its peak. If that person did not become really good at other social media like Insta or FB, he will be out of demand today as Twitter has become less attractive to businesses. 
It’s better to know something about every channel than to only ever work within one channel. That’s called being siloed and it’s the best way to never advance. Being curious and willing to get outside your comfort zone is so important. You don’t have to know every detail about every channel but general familiarity is goood. 
I got into digital marketing via politics. I knew a few platforms really well and when I launched my own business, I set out to learn "all of them." Quickly realized I was never going to be passionate about some (aka Pinterest) and while I try to have a general overarching understanding of the different platforms, I decided to focus in and be great at a few things, rather than okay at a lot of things. So far, it's been the right strategy for me.
it depends. if you are working in a small sized company, you need to have knowledge about all these different platforms. but in a big sized companies, usually each of these platforms are run by one or more digital marketing experts, experts specialized in that platform. So, first decide where you want to work and then make your knowledge general or special.
I have next to no knowledge about digital marketing, but I would say it's good to know a bit of each, and really focus on one and make it your specialty and area of expertise.
Here's a quick example: I am newly-pledged in the keto diet and I want to build a no-brain menu for a couple weeks ahead without spending much time to research on recipes but I also want to have variations and not get bored with what I eat - all in all, I want it all handed to me. I may search for "weekly keto menu" or "keto meals" or whatever. I want to find a particular solution to my problem and if yourwebsite provides me with that solution I will share it with my friends who are also on keto, here on Reddit where other people have a similar problem, and may even link to it if I have a blog or something.... You get the gist.

I would suggest moz and some udemy paid courses as well. They are only 10 bucks and you will learn something. 
Also there is a blog about SEO called backlinko.
Google it this guy knows his shit.
There are many free course available on Udemy . 
Check your library and see if your library card gets you access to Lynda.com
I think forums and online communities are the best.Beacause there are many problems out there from which you can learn daily.
There are many free course available but I suggest you watch the video of SEO beginners guidelines & Digital Marketing.

4. Agree the opportunities you’re going after AND commercials against these. 
You probably also want to get an expert mentor to help guide you. 
Hope this is just the beginning! 
And more. Dont drop the ball there. 
Never work for free.
Your definition is right, but Google Analytics also defines a Landing Page as the first page someone lands on on your website. So...he's also sorta right, but only if the traffic hits there first.
Yes, you're right. 
I worked at a company where we were always instructed to make "landing pages" with a bunch of call-to-actions, in addition to the product listings plus more information. No, these are regular pages. Plus, it's never good to have a bunch of (unrelated) CTAs.. However, sometimes those pages were hailed as good examples by the higher-ups who didn't know better.
I hated it. They clearly didn't know what they were doing and I didn't have the authority to correct them. Happily I'm no longer there.
Landing pages in web design is a page that’s disconnected from your website. Typically these pages don’t have navigation, and they are used to capture email addresses or promote a product. Landing pages for email marketers is place where the email traffic is sent, the destination of your email click-throughs.
You are correct. Landing pages have one goal for me and that's to convert a user. 
I’m with you - a landing page is a page where a single action is emphasized in order to gain a conversion. However, it things it more of a semantic thing than anything else, as in you "land" at a certain page. In any case, a landing page is a very specific concept and that anyone involved with marketing should clearly know.  
Buffer for SM as a good 'ok' tool if they don't have anything in place
Aside from what's already been mentioned, I would add: AirTable (task management), Nightwatch (SEO), Help Scout (Help desk email software), Grammarly (content grammar reviewer), and Hunter (finding emails for outreach). 
1. Google sheet- for planing, media calendar, tracking and collaboration 
3. Canva for image and inforgraphics
5. CRM tool from sales force, hibspot and more..
Majority of my work is in SEO, but use these on pretty much a daily basis:
Ahrefs - might just be the best all-round SEO tool on the market given all the features it has now
The other tool I use almost daily is Basecamp for client comms, but I don't think it's great by any means. In fact my friends and I are so disillusioned with it that we're launching our own comms platform in the new year. Trying to avoid shameless self-promotion, but feel free to swing me a message if you wanna swap stories on how bad BC is.
1. Social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter)  
I use Pexels too and it's great. Sometimes, I need to source more organic-looking photos that aren't as stylized and airbrushed. For these, I also check Flickr. Sometimes you find little gems with a creative commons license that allows you to use images for free. Another option is to link up with an upcoming photographer and work out an arrangement to use pictures from their portfolio for an economical price. Or, work out an arrangement to have them do scaled-down shoots for you cost-effectively. E.g. One of my clients paid $100 per week for 4 weekly photos that followed very loose creative guidelines that I stipulated. Lastly, don't ignore user generated content, or curating photos from other creators on social media that align with your style. So long as you give attribution and/or ask for permission, this is totally Ok. Good luck!
I have a preference for customers who are in the entertainment industry who I can set up an automated workflow for. So I focus on companies on IG who have weak ads, judge which ones that I believe have budget and are compatible with my strengths, and meet them in person. 
Start Locally, find a local business in need of a major social media upgrade, create an objective list of everything that needs done, and request a meeting with your local business. Let them know who you are, what you do, and how you can improve their overall social presence organically and through digital marketing. Ask them for their goals... do they want to increase business? Do they want more followers? Do they want more site visitors? ... Then create the roadmap and let them know what you charge for your services. Start them on a monthly retainer and layout the monthly goals and objectives. If you get them moving in the right direction, take note in how much they increase and use that to your advantage on finding your next paying client.
IMHO it's all about professional experience. I've had many marketing grads work under me and the only use I've seen them make of their degrees was that they learned how to use powerpoint, photoshop and other programs to make presentations in college which helped them a bit. I've worked my way up in the business with no bachelor's, but imagine doing as I did would be more difficult if you were starting out today because digital marketing is a more mature marketplace now than it was ten years ago.
Depends. On the junior levels, nah. That's mostly leg work which anybody can learn; SEO, PPC and SEM.
On more strategic roles though, traditional marketing knowledge is required. Someone with a degree wont have to learn it while someone without it will spend some time learning basic concepts.
Yes. Digital marketing is still an arm of the overall concept of marketing. A lot of digital marketing concepts came from "traditional" marketing. What's good about digital marketing is it is now highly measurable. 
Notice that there's no "Marketing Degree" in there? Ok, here's an opportunity to offend a bunch of people - but recall college. Who was majoring in Marketing? It was mostly the people who sort of sucked at math right? Marketing major - that's typically the easiest business focus degree. I know that it's not true in all cases. I know that marketing degrees and their subsequent value vary wildly depending on the institution. (enough disclaimers?)
But, no - I don't actively search them out, because. 
** the current marketing environment has a severe distaste for anything 10yo. It's gotta be fresh. 
** they instead teach theory and general strategy - and confuse the shit out of advertising and marketing semantics. 
Marketing (specially digital) requires an intense attention to detail. It's a technical field now. I don't understand why more people don't get this. Marketing departments are usually spending more on software and infrastructure than the f'ng IT dept these days. 
Drop outs, that have somehow found success and traction in marketing -  have hustle. They are usually also humble. They have a chip on their shoulder. They know they have to work harder and put in an unusual amount of effort to EARN their success compared to their college colleagues. 
What I mean is that it seems like college conditions people to want super clear micro instruction..... just like a course syllabus. What's the extra credit? Do I get in trouble if I miss too many classes? How many words does the essay have to be?  They want to know if I do X Y Z then I will get a raise of B. 
But, I SO value people who generate their own success. I love fresh ideas. I love people who not only have good ideas, but actually GET SHIT DONE. I promote generously. In the last three years I've given out 3 50% raises. I've also opened up profit sharing for certain high value folks that I want to keep on the team. But, I'm not going to give people the ikea instructions on how to get there. 
Otherwise - I'm just delegating shit right? Instead, the people who really make a positive impact are ADDING to the ideas and execution of the organization. 
I feel like college is doing a disservice by stripping that away from a lot of people. I believe that is because of the rise of academic bueracracy and the increasing prevalance of life long / career silo'd academics who are disconnected from the speed and culture of current marketplace innovation.  
Like everyone here, we'll agree there's nothing better than experience. So, you're prob going to have to work for peanuts out of the gate, but take advantage of the situation. Learn EVERY piece of ad/martech that they have inhouse. Download all the manuals. Study cram for the tests..... get certified. Never eat lunch alone. Network your ass off. Be helpful in everything you do. Your job is to make your boss look good.... don't inflate with pride and demand a raise three months into it. Lock in a promotion in your first gig - transition into a junior role at a consulting firm where you'll learn from extremely experienced consultant peers at a break neck pace on dozens of clients simultaneously.... there's no better way to gain experience than that.
Then - get promoted at the consultancy, then take your pick from the clients.... you'll have a front row view into their org, and will likely hit that director level 5-6 years before your marketing major in house team peers. 
I did a degree in marketing (Bcomm) and have now worked in the digital marketing field for 5+ years. I would say the degree was useful for better understanding business in general, this is key in any role, especially marketing. However, almost none of what I do from a technical skill set perspective was learn't during my degree. So while I think a degree can be helpful, I don't think it is required, you could start learning digital marketing without and there are tons of free online resources to help with this! 
I think the bigger indicator is mathematical/analytical ability. I’d much rather hire a finance major with no digital experience than a marketing major who has never had to interpret 100,000 lines of funnel data. 
I believe that it depends on how open to learn is the person. If it is a professional with experience, he or she already know the importance and shift of the new paradigm for marketing for this era. I am in the middle, being stuck with traditional knowledge but open to learn and gain new experience from the new digital era. Change is hard, but it is part of human evolution. Or either you grow, or perish with your old ways and ideas.
I don’t think someone with a degree in traditional marketing is qualified to work in marketing...
Digital marketing is like a car. Windshield breaks go to windshield guy. New tires, tires guy. 
I agree, I would start with AdWords certification and google analytics certifications because they are free. Hubspot has a free inbound marketing course/certification I plan to take as well even though I use Marketo and am not a novice by any means. I understand your company is allowing you to spend a certain amount on continuing education, but perhaps they’d allow you to put it towards a digital marketing tradeshow instead if you are able to get several free certifications. 
The Udemy course is more thorough though, and longer.
In the mean time, how about analytics / AdWords certifications if you haven’t already? I deal with clients all the time that are very relieved to know they’re working with someone with these certifications even though they’re basically a standardized requirement in our industry and  relatively easy to understand (lots to master) with a little work.
Search engine land is great for SEO/SEM content 
I like Search Engine Journal though I experienced some low-quality paid posts last weeks. Anyone else with the same thoughts?
How do I go about getting this certification? 
Do you have to pay?
AdWords certification is a nice to have, but a test doesn't accurately showcase your AdWord skills. 
I have both the AdWords and Analytics (nice to have for resumes) but no employer ever cared that I had it. It was the execution, ideas, and results that matter.
I have both Analytics and Adwords certificate, get in the queue junior.
Fundamentals, AdWords, Analytics, Shopping, Tag Manager. I have em all. All you have to do is show clients you can actually increase their sales (based on proof / previous success) and you will earn business regardless of certifications. 
Where do you live? Do you want a job?
I would. I would like a somewhat smaller group. Most of the slack channels are too big, I feel.
Yes! Please hook me up. :)
the customer journey ends in death.
Google Digital Garage (Digital Unlocked) is an excellent resource to learn almost every basic in digital marketing. Right from the need of going digital to use of all integrated components like SEO, SMM, PPC, and content, etc. all things are covered in this course. After final exam, you can receive a certificate.
I’ve had to train clients. No vertical video, focus, etc. i ask them to take “too many” and usually get 1-3 that work.
I’ve worked at 2 different agencies and neither offered photography/videography services. Does your agency only work with local businesses? In my experience, almost all of my clients were located far enough away that this wouldn’t be feasible.
I take photos and video as part of my services, the cost gets factored into the overall price.  It was frustrating for both me and my clients trying to get them to take acceptable photos / video as most have nothing more than their cell phone and don't understand proper lighting techniques.
What does the contract say?
This is typically an upsell. Last agency I worked with had a X fee per creative built into their contract
If not, DMA can have a list of partner photographers. It’s a win win. Photographer gets more gig from DMA and DMA can demand some discount so that they can show value to the Client.
Third way is to hire an in house photographer if you have such high demand. 
In my opinion, it’s better if DMA controls the photography needs of the client’s campaign. It would be a shame to watch bad photo from a client break DMA’s advertising effort.
I’ve worked with a couple kids who have digital marketing degrees. I’d rather hire a jr employee with an English degree or no degree at all because at least that kid won’t think he knows stuff.
I wouldn’t recommend it. I wish I hadn’t gotten a degree in this field because I’ve had to do continuing education. If you do then I would go for traditional marketing or something technology related.
I'm a digital marketer ( my degree is in Communication ) but I didn't receive any digital marketing training until after school. I found an entry level job at a Facebook marketing agency via Upwork. The training I got there was faster, cheaper, and way more comprehensive than I would've gotten in school. Plus I was working with tons of real clients every day.
I now run a marketing department for a multi-million dollar company but both my FB ads experience AND my degree got me in the door (plus a ton of hard work and self-teaching—Udemy has been a great resource). I wish I had spent more of my time in classes related to data and analytics. They are critical for any marketing role these days so I'd seriously recommend sharpening those skills! They'll take you far.
I did a comms degree (majoring in journalism) and that seems to benefit me more than a straight marketing degree. I did a bunch of marketing subjects, but I also know how to write - that’s a tougher skill to be able to glean from a job interview, but a journalism degree? They know I can write well.
Depends on the type of job you’re going for, but a whole marketing degree doesn’t sound flexible enough, and keep in mind that what you’re taught in a digital marketing subject WILL be slightly behind the times. When you finish your degree, the game will have changed. 
A marketing degree will teach you concepts. As a Kinesiology major in marketing, does it matter? I
Think you could get beyond that. One of my good friends in my company is one of the smartest people I know and had NO degree. It's the time and effort he's put in on the side and during the jobs he's landed.
Degrees can open the door, but aren't totally necessary. 
On top of my head, Schedule Webinars. They work like magic in education sector.
Also, get the website optimized. One of the Reasons why it's failing is this. Will you trust an education course of 850£ with shitty website? 
Sell them some on site-optimization, and explain to them why it's badly needed.
Sounds like a project you shouldn’t have bother taking and possibly didn’t qualify enough for yourself.
I’d walk away tbh. 
Bottom line - cut your losses and walk away. 
If they have a crap site and no traffic, you’re spinning wheels.
The money is not worth the headache, your time, your extra effort, your personal name and reputation.
They clearly don’t get you, the communication isn’t on the same page, and they’re pulling you all over the place. 
Just my opinion.
I wouldn’t have even agreed to this job and would’ve qualified further before hand. 
Maybe targeting is off? Get more specific in the demographic, age range, location etc... 
Run it against the current ads and see if traffic increases. 
Perpetual traffic by Digital marketer, particularly episodes with Ezra and Molly. Then just trial and error.
Experiment and learn from experience. That's the only way to learn. 
In addition to what everyone's mentioned, try not to make your audiences too granular. Lump like audiences together so FB's algorithm has more data to work off of.
Does the gallery have a social presence yet? If not, I'll start with that first to bring in some organic traffic. Facebook, Instagram and maybe Pinterest. You can work you way into paid search and social. Content marketing is something I would focus on.
They might ask you to show them your personal social media accounts. Make sure to delete every negative post! And they might ask you on how you would improve their social media accounts. My first job out of college was a social media manager. It's a fun job but it does suck the life out of you if you don't have good time management. Good luck!
What is an area you wish to work on?
- he had clearly spent a lot of time looking at our existing channels, understanding their purpose and the content that they promoted
- he demonstrated that he knew that constant testing and learning was crucial
They’ll ask you 1) thoughts on company’s  current social media strategy, what’s good and bad about it and 2) fave social media profiles for each channel. Have examples to back up choices.
It will be basically regarding the social media strategy, social media calendar, KPIs, campaigns, paid ads etc. 
Now, get started with the account creation on social channels and designing the website (if not already done). Try to keep the website clean, and mobile-friendly, and speedy, plus easy-to-go content that answers the customer side. Also put some opt-ins to generate sleeping leads.
I know it has been a vague answer. I am struggling with my karma. So yeah. :P
Social Media Platforms are the biggest brand creators now a days so i would suggest campaigns over there.  
"the most efficient way to spend my time at this point." 
Draft a statement of work that clearly defines each deliverable, with a payment triggers for each. If not, an easier way would be to define your hourly rate and approximate the hours per deliverable. He may be your friend, but unless he's paying you a salary, set clear expectations. 
 *  Landing pages
 *  Assumptions. These are very important. If there are any dependencies - this is where they go. If you need him to pay his IT person to work with you, or if you need payments to be current so you can pay subcontractors, that he will provide calendar availability for feedback.
 *  Recurring charges. A retainer is a good way to keep a minimum amount of hours available only to them so you do not take on other commitments that would preclude you from servicing their account. Good for both parties.
PM if you want something more formal. I know I'm leaving details out because it's Friday and I'm on my cell!
If this is an ecomm startup, Shopify is a great solution with a fair amount of customizability and a ton of free apps that integrate extremely well with both Google Ads and Paid Social. 
Finally, a bit in the weeds, but MOTION MOTION MOTION for creative. It may seem daunting depending on your skills, but even a basic gif with early quick cuts will outperform a static most of the time and pretty much guarantee a lower CPM.
Do this, forget about the bid amount set it to maximize clicks don't set any bid amount, at least run it 2 days after that pause the ad and review your ad with search terms, after this you can find out what's your negative keywords and best keywords that you can get maximum clicks  then adjust the bid amount with respective of that.
I also asked this question on the Google Ads user forum and someone there suggested that my $10/day budget is too small.  Thoughts on that?  What do you think is the minimum daily budget to be competitive enough to get your ads seen?
I really need to either solve this or know for sure if I should drop it and move my March campaign back to Facebook.  (I know they're not the same kinds of advertising platforms.  I hoped to do both, actually.)
Have you tried freelance websites like Fiverr and UpWork? Easy way to build up a portfolio.
IMO cold mailing for SEO services goes straight into the junk folder and deleted. I wouldn't bother unless you heavily personalise your proposals towards local businesses.
You want to get into local SEO but not approach local businesses because they don't have a web presence? Sounds like you've found a niche, offer a website + SEO package!
\*City\* SEO agency
Definitely start locally, but if you want to keep trying cold emails, try Facebook instead. Many companies have a Facebook page where you can message them and I've gotten a much better response rate. Not that it's a good response rate, but it's 10x better than email
Funny though learning never ends.
3. Do you know how code powers our daily lives?
4. Do you understand basic machine learning?
Cold emailing out of the blue is not going to work well, nor will you be trusted. There is a lot you can be doing to be seen, just cold emailing and hoping for work is not going to cut it. 
You might be able to get some sort of low end freelance gigs but you do need a degree ( though Not necessarily in marketing). You will make way more money in the long run with that diploma. 
Look, you have no idea yet if you really want to pursue a marketing career yet. But not having a degree limits you SO much. Plus college teaches you important shit like how to build your network and communication skills. What do you think a big client is going to think when your campaign reports are full of shitty misspellings? Do you think clients will even hire someone who can’t write persuasively?
Yeah college is useless
Perhaps start with an internship that would kill two birds one stone 
Don’t waste money on college
I would not be where I am today if I didn’t have a degree. Even though I had to teach myself everything I know about digital marketing, you still need the degree to get your foot in the door. 
Depends on how much you want to be earning in 10-20 years. Can you find an entry-level job without a degree? Yes (though it'll be harder). Can you earn $100k+ in 10 years without a degree? Almost certainly not. Can you earn $200k+ in 20 year? No. 
In the marketing industry, a degree is most likely needed. Degree gives you a huge upper hand in employment, showing your value, and you learn a lot of skills in college with that. When starting your own biz, you can use your degree as a “selling point” saying  you have a degree and know what your talking about. Gives your clients social proof you have experience. 
It depends. I don’t think there is a clear cut answer. I went to school for web design and I did freelance for a number of years. I am a digital PM and my degree only helped because I was able to spin it in a way that allows me to speak about design in addition to the skills that you can learn without the degree.
I do not have a degree in marketing or digital marketing. I went to college for graphic design and also have a minor in communications. But, that degree got me my first job in email marketing. Now 8 years later, I'm the head of marketing for a software company. 
While College may have cost me money and I did not go into my field of study,  I learned a lot that applied to my career and networking.
If it were me starting over again, I'd do a specialized marketing degree in like a 6-9 month (cheaper than a 4 year degree) and do all the free online certifications I could. Then take some internships or even freelance entry level marketing gigs. 
Degrees are not required, but they do open doors. Anecdotally, the agency I work at openly says degrees are not required and will often talk about how experience and passion is all that matters... but everyone that works here *does* have a degree in something, lol.
Safe (but mostly useless) degrees would be Business, Communications.
SEO, Search Engine Marketing, Paid Advertising, Email Marketing, and Social Media Marketing. There’s subsets to these and additional skills needed. 
Digital marketing have to segment i.e Inbound Marketing and outbound marketing. Inbound marketing have different segment like SEO, SMO, Content Marketing, Email Marketing, PPC, Paid Marketing,  and etc. 
Outbound marketing have different segment like Email Marketing, Cold Calling, Printing Advertising, Television Advertising and etc. 
I enjoy working in this field which results me in less stress & a happy working life. There is no need to change your career & you stated that you enjoy digital marketing. 
Trust me, I am not lying. 
I have seen many people who are earning millions in different fields but living a very stressful & unhappy life. Reason is they have 'Work Load'.
It varies places to place & company to company. Digital Marketing as a career is very broad. It  got may leaves like:
I work as a digital marketing manager, and my background is web designing, and trust me....this field is the future, digital media is on fire...

As someone who's in a dm course rn, what came up to me was the heavy use of excel and reports. Downloading loads of data in cvs fr fb, google analytics, and other softwares, number crunching them to calcuate engagemenr rate, cpc, and the like, comparing to previously on thr same platform or against other platforms. 
Been in digit marketing / e-commerce for 8 years now. I can't imagine doing anything different. 
I've always wanted to work on products and campaigns that outside people would see and notice and I definitely get that with digital marketing. 
Additionally, it's just fun. I don't think there's any other industry that allows you to hypothesize, create, deploy, and evaluate so quickly. Validation is one of my keys to happiness. 
Digital Marketing is all about experience and results.
Digital marketing isn't just a single thing, there are many branches of digital marketing. Those are SEO, social media marketing, email marketing, online advertising, and so on. So, you should know about all these things prior to changing your career to digital marketing.
Depends the country you are in. For example, Full stack marketing is always in demand but it is also very demanding because you need to be both creative and technical. 
I am trying to get into DM without a  degree and a blue collar background. Taking some courses now at age 31. What are my odds landing a job? 
I'm 33 and have been doing this since I was about 26. The people are generally pretty young, office culture is generally cool, and the work is varied. Lots of growth potential and many different areas you can lean into. I also really enjoyed drinking profusely and hooking up with girls at all the ad industry parties when I first started working in agencies. There's something to be said for the social opportunities your job provides.
I've also managed to be promoted many times and make a six figure salary without too much effort. I never work late at my current client-side job, and rarely did when I worked in agencies. My stress level is about zero. Not sure if that's because I'm very smart or other people are very dumb, maybe a little of both :)
I have been working in digital marketing since 2018, 1+ year, and I should say that I love what I am doing. Digital marketing is so versatile, it will never make you bored since you can easily change the activity: SEO, Content Marketing, SMM, E-mail Marketing, etc. The job is full of creativity and interesting things. 
I work in digital marketing and it is by far the best profession I have been in. The exposure to the online world is immense. 
I would run 🏃 🏃‍♀️ away from a dm degree. I would rather get a marketing degree. 
Teaching yourself anything for free is possible. Focus on your studies but the most valuable things you get are 1) the degree that gets you an interview and 2) the connections and network building
That said, people can't understand that digital marketing is marketing with real time data.
Self studying for sure. I joined a start up so I'm not sure how the hiring process for bigger firms are like. I had some prior experience in marketing for school councils and stuff so that was my "work experience" when I applied. 
I do not have a digital marketing or marketing degree. I went to school for graphic design and got a minor in communications. I fell into email marketing by chance, where I learned that area of marketing more in-depth. I mostly learned on my own and by creating a blog, which I could put on my resume. 
From there, I got interested in Google Ads and Analytics. Took the free courses, followed marketing blogs, and then stumbled on HubSpots free certification. Those things allowed me to get in with a marketing agency, which taught me the rest. 
Interested! Dm me 
Hey, I’m not looking for an official partner but I’m always looking for someone to chat, brainstorm/ bounce ideas off and help each other out. My

isn't product marketing what is generally written about when someone writes about marketing in general?
1. They are exploiting you by having you perform a higher function without the appropriate pay.
If you believe you have the qualifications and experience to take up a senior role at another company, then maybe it's time to move on. If not, then the experience you are getting is a valuable way to progress your career. 
Instead of asking for the raise ask for a 3 to 6 month growth plan that Makes the benchmarks clear and the ending salary clear. "if I do x,y,z successfully (define successfully) my new title and salary will be 70k in August". Get it signed. 
Check salary.com but to me it sounds underpaid. SF is the most expensive city in the country. They should be able to afford you and it sounds like you deliver value. 
Their is no doubt that you should be paid well and something better than you are getting now.  Although, I think your boss has some point
> I need to prove myself in the new role first.
I mean he is taking more work from you which means he is showing some faith in you. He is providing you the opportunity that you need at this stage of your career but. You see, right now you are just another one who is getting promoted. You must try to be the only one.
Hey there I just went through this at my
Job. I have a creative field salary guide that shows every single job in our field. I actually just used it to show my boss my desired salary... I’m in the SF Bay Area but my .org is based in a LCOL area but that doesn’t matter ... PM me and I can swing it your way 
Consider asking this question to your boss in the appropriate setting:
I work in an agency environment and if someone asked that, we would co-create a plan!
Your boss is wasting your time, no offense bro but he knows you're worth way more than that. Pulling your chain.
There’s not much you can do. Facebook engagement and reach is just really tiny compared to instagram. The best thing you can do is make videos. they tend to get more reach and can go viral with shares. Educational videos can go really well on FB so its worth a go.
Other than that, try to focus on Instagram where the reach is so so much better. Facebook is around 5% of the audience where insta is 30%. 
A reasonable goal would be to try and increase that monthly follower growth rate by 1.5x in a quarter. You can also use small paid budgets to boost your organic posts to a wider audience.
Where's the business overall marketing plan? Everything you do, including SMM, should be based on a master marketing plan. Is you boss providing you this?
Well you sure are a bright one I’m not sure what this company saw in you sir but you are clueless.You can’t run a Facebook page and they even give you a budget I don’t see good things for this company in the near future I don’t care how you put it.
As always, there are other tools in the market that promise to deliver on this front, but you can always improve on them.
I delivered a project on a content marketing tool called compendium. There were some "AI" tools built into the application but they were more like experimental rather than useful. 
Now a days AI can very helpful. But they don't have the idea comparing to us.
**2: Not having the proper talent.** 
This can be a important issue for legacy marketing teams that have tried to retrofit people into content marketing jobs. 
This is a question of distribution. You’re surely spending a lot of attempt creating content, but are you spending much time and money pushing the content to the right audience? Target right audience.
It’s common for companies to not have all the content they need to move prospects along the sales funnel. So make a content that don't have any gap.
This doesn’t just apply to content marketing; it applies to all marketing.
Some people hate udemy courses. I love them. 
Btw courses are almost always $11. Whenever I see a course I want I just make a new account and gift it to my actual one so I get the introductory rate. 
Udemy's pricing is an asshole sometimes lol
I'm doing it as well. But honestly it seems like the course only teaches you how to follow, not how to lead. Most if it is look at your competitors and duplicate them
I came to this sub to post a similar question. Interested in a pursuing a career in this industry. It look seems quite interesting, fun, potentially lucrative, and room for growth in the future. 
If not Udemy, is there a specific path anyone might suggest to learn more about a career in digital marketing?
Analytics, similarweb etc.
Sounds like you have no data to work with already?
Google ads has great analytics, and you can upload costs in GA to give you ROI or ROAS. If you want to take it one step further you could connect it to Data studio and upload all your external data to give you a really robust picture.
Hope that helps!
Google Analytics and specific tools for channels such as google ads for adwords. 
I don’t have one set tool, but instead have specific metrics I pull from each platform to calculate ROAS.
The reality is that "digital marketing" is a loose term in 2018, and that in order to excel, you don't necessarily you need to technical you just need to get results.
I have my own agency and have interviewed a few people who said they did SEO, social media, or websites, and I tell them I don't care about your resume, where you worked, or where you learned what you say you know, just need me links to your sample work or portfolio, and let me do my own research. It is amazing how many people fake it in digital marketing, and the analytics never lie when you check their work sample.
That being said, I have found the technical skills are the ones people are willing to pay for. It took me 3 years of banging my head with Youtube to get where I am today, but have enough of a skill set that I can convince businesses or clients to give me 10% of all the revenue I generate for them. CSS/HTML/SEO and marketing automations with API's are where the money at, and where even small business owners are willing to spend money to take a risk on scaling on their business. 
Just learn some basic coding skill with tracking insertion. It's where the money is beside strategy, so learn it. 
Technically, the answer is yes, but as I learned, the more of the basic tech you now the better, if only to hold a reasonable conversation the IT Department or the Webmaster or any others on the tech side.  It's also not that hard to learn if you approach it systematically or step by step or whatever learning process works best for you.  
I was a graphic and web designer before going to grad school for PR. While I already had some technical skills that have helped me tremendously, the concepts behind PR have also made me a better marketer. Too many marketers focus only on short-term results, where public relations professionals usually take the long-term reputation view. 
I’ve found many more opportunities since moving from communication roles to digital marketing. 
Wow that is some bullshit test mate. Everyone has to start somewhere right?
This is hilarious because at my last agency, all digital team members had less than 2 years of experience. We were responsible for multiple campaigns that made up 25k + monthly retainers. The results? We never had a client renew after 6 months. Lol
Although for SEO, we hit a lot of our KPIs. It was really more social that was a fail.
I would also say WordPress. for all the reasons Arthur has outlined. Wix is new and I havent tried it. It might be better, but just not as widely used as WP
Wix is the worst in regards to SEO. Wordpress is the best CMS if you ever plan on doing SEO. 
It offers a free hosting as well.
I have no experience with Tinder, but I feel like there's a solid lack of intent there. I have used Snapchat quite a bit. It has a pretty cheap CPC, but overall bounce rate is high. Most likely due to my client's services not being the best for the platform, but it's a nice channel for excess budget.
2. Don't think 3rd party hosting is an option with Snapchat, so you rely on platform data, which covers bare bones delivery metrics and engagement.
3. Snapchat is typically short form heavily branded video. I think display is an option, but the main engagement is "swipe up to see more".
4. Snapchat has the basic demographic and affinity/interest categories. They have a few 3rd party data behavioral audiences that are interesting.
I don't know about Tinder Ads and Snapchat ads because they are expensive. But have you tried using a DSP?
Other curiosity was the reported high number of "Swipe ups" from snaps analytics platform but metrics from the destination analytics showed no increase in traffic. Snap were unable to explain this, but insisted they had to charge us for the swipe ups.
Saying SEO is dead
Also, nothing about investing in video is innovative at this point unless you have a way to send your content directly into my brain.
Powtoon is my favorite and I've tried damn near all of them
i would like to prefer  VideoScribe  and Camtasia . Both these tool are really good for  Agency and the Pro+ plan 
Very basic editing windows movie maker...
Maybe because it's still an emerging market? I'm not entirely sure.
I joined this sub when I started working for a digi firm and was bummed to see that there's not a lot going on. There's so much to learn every day as this field is constantly evolving.
Honestly? I just don't feel like there are any experts here. Everyone seems to be early in their career and there's way too many "How much should I charge" questions.
/u/ScotchHarbour and /u/BigRodVonHugenDong are giving you great advice. Get AdWords certified, learn the ins and outs of Excel, and master analytics. That'll help you skip the peon steps of stuff you've already done (SEO, PPC, ETC) and help you become the boss of strategy. You've got good experience it sounds like, so you probably don't need to start at the bottom.
Hey, I'm now a mod here, also over at /r/webmarketing (thanks for visiting). I'm working on cleanup. Please keep reporting to help me get through all this junk.
Thanks for the referral. Definitely looks like a better community. Shame, really, since this one has potential and I feel like there are a lot of quality lurkers. Just seems there are more spammers. See you over there.
I work in digital marketing FT for 3 years now... honestly it encompasses so much that it really depends on the company you work for and who (or who's not) on the marketing team. Need a website fixed but no in-house developer? Congrats! You're the new webmaster. Have a new company newsletter coming out but no editor? Cool, you're now the content manager! I'd say if you work for an agency you'll get the typical cookie-cutter job, but this isn't typical. Cookie cutter: social media, paid search, SEO, SEM, google analytics number crunching, landing page conversion, ecommerce, ALL of lead generation, content development, and SO MUCH MORE!! I disagree with poster above, support roles for sales are called most often SDRs - or sales development reps. Not digital marketing related, but lead generation related.
What type of digital marketing?  It encompasses a variety of things...  could mean websites, SEM, Facebook ads, reputation management, mobile ads, display ads, etc. etc.
So, from what I've gathered so far, there are:
- technical jobs not directly related to marketing - web design, someone mentioned programmers
- account manager - someone who handles everything the agency does for a particular client?
Are there any other typically functions inside an ad agency that I'm missing?
Hi, that is a vast topic to understand by a single post or comment. There is so much going on in the digital marketing field that it has become a subject of study for graduation in some colleges. 
As a digital marketer manager myself, being a generalist can be very marketable, but being a specialist can often be preferable. Particularly from a freelance perspective.
Video editing is similar, but the learning curve isn't quite as substantial.  Hope this helps.
There are also a few sites that give all the answers. It  would suck to waste two hours writing the test only to get 79% and fail. What I did, always make your selection first and then reference the answers from a cheat site. This way you're learning too.
It's important to have the skills but the actual certification itself is not a very valuable one. 
I've basically hired people based on having the certification over others. It was on top of showing proficiency on the topics in the interview, but also shows they took the effort, either to get the certification or cheat. Both show initiative and ability to problem solve. 
Great post, can you recommend the tool you use to monitor specific topics on social media?

Posted a new update above
Injured my back but got a HEAP done today and yesterday, didnt have chance to post!
Its since had over 12,000 views on Inbound, was shared by Hubspot and many others, and resulted in mid 5 figure sales this week alone.....
Ive been focusing on Internet Video Marketing too much lately, 
The money is still truly "In The List"
Commenting to follow progress. I'm at the digital marketing exchange in Cali right now and this excites me 
I love Reddit and I know this dude berry well. Please don't up vote this is just a test ? 
That being said, several users are doing it over insta and i have suscribed to them.
Step 1 - Your spotify list must be really unique and appeal to a certain demographic (if you don't do this no marketing gimmicks will help you gain traction)
Step 2 - I would approach a designer/illustrator to generate a logo to accompany your playlist and social media content so as to make your brand identifiable and stand out
If you have experience/samples from previous work that would apply to this company, reference that and try to steer clear of laying out all your great ideas before they make a hiring decision.
Show them what having YOU on the team could mean for their overall growth strategy, not just your ideas.
By X amount of prospects, do you mean leads? It really depends what area of digital marketing you're focusing on.
 What I would also make sure is that everything is tight knit and ignore volume. Reason I say this is because 1. Google keyword planner is not 100% accurate when it comes to volume statistics and 2. Because it's better to have low volume and a high amount of conversions than high volume and a low amount of conversions. Why? Because having lots of volume but low conversions is literally flushing money down the drain. And conversions = money... And that's the end goal here. I would build up my ad groups, keywords and negative keyword list. Then I would create three ads per ad group for a/b split testing. I would also tack on two ad extensions for all ads, which the most common ones are call extensions and locations extensions. Those two get the most clicks. Then I would check the site to see if it's optimized for mobile as well as the sites loading times. Mobile is especially important because 60% of people today now surf the web with their smartphones according to mozcon. Then I would finally create a retargeting campaign because 95% of people who go onto your page leave within the next 5 seconds, but when your ad tracks then, your conversions rise.
Depending how how advanced they are even simple things like that could blow their mind.
Agencies are desperate for help these days. They are willing to hire people that don't have that much experience but rather good knowledge about digital marketing concepts. You already have the certifications, which shows the employer that you care about learning.
But like others have said, apply to a marketing agency. I started out that way, learned ALOT, they also are willing to teach you too. It can elevate your marketing career. Don't expect to make a lot of money right away, but in two years I gained so much knowledge and doubled my salary.
How about taking up internships? That's the easiest doorway to establish yourself for a digital marketing role within any company;  Try it for 2-3 months, learn as much as you can and do your best to impress, if they like you, quite likely you'll get converted to full time. as an intern, people expect less from you, so this is the best time for you to shine!
I got into digital marketing at an entry level by knowing someone is the business, however another person came on right before me as an intern, because of his eagerness to succeed  and the work he put in, he was offered a full time position within 2-3 months... just a little encouragement, give it a try!
Just wanted to wish you best of luck, I’m in the same boat!! I’m currently a Spanish/ESOL teacher but want this to be my last year, aka I want to be done teaching in June and start a new job in August. I’ve been studying on my own like crazy. It’s nerve-wracking to think about job searching in a completely new field, but this post makes me feel hopeful. Best of luck to you!!!
It IS possible. I was in the exact same situation about 8 months ago. It took me about 2 months after leaving my current job at the time to learn everything I could about digital marketing, which might seem too short a time to learn about DM, but since I had a background in marketing/advertising (being a communication arts graduate), everything I studied within the 2-month time frame was easy to digest.
Google Docs + EverNote + Google Calendar and iOS Calendar synched up.  I'm also super OCD in terms of staying organized, but I don't necessarily spend a lot of time (or any money at all) to do so.
The most important tip is to break down your tasks to smaller tasks - put them in your calendar and work on it!
I use a bullet journal! I used normal planners religiously in school but most of them weren't quite the right format for work
Remember the milk is an amazing tool and not just for work. I use it to manage all of my tasks, for today, tomorrow and into the future. Highly recommend, but you have to be religious about using it across all platforms. 
I used to use wunderlist but it wouldn’t load when I was on the subway. Remember the milk is way more stable and does a better job of syncing across multiple platforms.
I use Monday - and I have a notebook with a table of contents that I carefully keep track of for different topics...kinda like a bullet journal but not really
I will not work without Asana. It’s better if a team uses it but it’s quite useful on its own as well.
Trello for tasks, Drive for file storage and documents, Slack for chat. my team haven’t invested into any schedulers yet so i just use Facebook for scheduling.
am I a dork for emailing myself to do lists before I close for the day?
Physical agenda to write out notes so I can write everything down as it comes. 
Social media scheduling tools 
For short term projects I can add other people to my list, create tasks with sub tasks, add notes to my tasks and upload related files to each. I also have tasks for personal things like groceries since I have the app on my phone and can add them on the fly.
In the past I have also used .txt files. And Trello. And Wunderlist. All systems worked. But Outlook Calendar plus Confluence seems to work the best for me.
>capabilities to get a quick high high level look at competitor metrics like followers, engagement rates, type of content, etc. 
And yes, I would really recommend checking out the social media workflows at the Easy Solutions page, as u/vendetta4guitar has suggested. ;)
I'm on the same boat. Im trying to get my competitor facebook page insight but cant find a tool. For example, i want to find their target audience.
Ahrefs  is the best tool for competitor analysis...
Similarweb  - it varies in accuracy though but you get a basic picture
Finally, there is benchmarking, where a brand could use listening data to compare their engagement and/or brand perception against their competitors.
Broadly speaking, monitoring is intended to provide you with items to act on. Comments on your FB posts, posts using your branded hashtags, people speaking negatively about your brand on Twitter, etc.
Listening is more of a research activity, where you try to gather additional consumer data on a certain topic that feeds back into your marketing or R&D department, but is not directly actionable. I.e. if I’m in the umbrella business and I want to gather knowledge about people’s behavior and attitudes around rain, I would listen on social around that subject and gather data that my engineers can use to make a better umbrella - but I wouldn’t reply to each person talking about rain trying to sell them my umbrella.
I think both are same because these are the ways to analysis and prepare the social marketing strategy. From my point of view social monitoring and social listening tools  are different.
Google Data Studio has a Facebook connector. Have you tried that?
You might want to use facebook offline attribution tool if you manage to get hold their offline data. (disclaimer: make sure your client knows you are going to upload the data on Facebook). 
You hit the nail on the head, I want to see revenue. You should have been looking at these numbers throughout the year. Waiting until now is like is waiting month to optimize someone. All your metrics are vanity numbers that don't mean much. Maybe this client won't care but you have totally done this backwards.
The huge downside is if the lead quality is not optimized then all the leads in the world don't matter. This is the big issue we see with client's who left another agency. Getting leads isn't good enough... you should work with the client to make sure they get closed. 
While we charge a retainer but we monitor closely the sales funnel. The way we do it is by giving them our lead management system which is linked with all the lead sources. Tracking their statuses into conversion (marked by clients) helps in optimising the lead quality. 
Our agency is moving toward a per-lead cost for some services like mobile ads and automated marketing but not for primary services like SEO, SMM, and PPC.
\-Just let them know what you want to learn, and tell them they do it well (bonus if they actually do). 
I'm starting to get soured on the field after years. I started my career at a digital agency. Everything was new bright and shiny.
After some years and promotions I felt that I could no longer sustain what was being asked from me. Agency stress level is 6 to 10. Everything can be cool while it's going well, but just like another poster said if things outside your control happen and success stops you can feel intense pressure. Again this is only agency side and only if you really let it effect you (I was extremely invested in the clients success and the company including appearing on podcasts/talk shows and we had our own digital show). Workload during this time was around 60-80/week.
I left agency life to be an independent contractor while I figure out what to do with my life. The money is great and the freedom is fantastic (I bought a camper with the GF and we are just traveling and working remotely). Workload now is around 30 hours, stress level 2/10.
It is definitely worth going to an agency to learn. There is no where else you will learn the cutting of edge of all digital marketing skills. 
Let me know if you have any questions, good luck!
I can answer a few. I love my career so far in DM. It’s fun, I get to use my creative side and come up with ideas, and my job allows me travel as we have conferences in cool locations (going to Hawaii in 3 weeks with them) which is cool. I used to be salary at my job which I hated. I’m hourly timesheet now. Do I work more then 40 hours? Sometimes. Depends what events we have going on. But I don’t mind overtime here and there. Extra money never hurts..
I get to work on our website, email campaigns , mobile app, partner marketing ... it’s really enjoyable and I want to stay in this field. I just went to a marketing / creative field forum and they talked about how our field is hot right now and will continue to be...
My stress level is usually middle of the road. I'm focused on e-commerce, so we have very specific goals we are trying to hit. When things are going well it is very exciting. When we're not hitting our revenue goals it can be very stressful. I work in-house, and it is much less stressful than when I worked for an agency. 
My hours are typically 40ish. But I think it really depends on what company you work for and what aspect of digital marketing you are in. For example, during busy season, I often take work home over the weekend or in the evening. If you get into social media, you may be responding to comments or messages at all hours. 
It's fun and also stressful. Many nights your up late. The worst thing is dealing with bad clients though and you need to learn to just drop them.
Yes there is stress but as the time goes by you become better with your output. So, now i am about 4/10 since i transitioned from digital marketer to full stack marketer
Hours? Something close to 14 hours a day, every day.
Certification is something important but not everyone requires them \[since not everyone knows they exist\]
The problem is the awful pay here (Greece) that is why i am beginning to expand into other countries.
Wow something new I learned, lol, seriously I am getting ready to roll out ads.  I just would like to know any alternatives that won't hurt my wallet. 
1. How much revenue was this campaign relative to the rest of the media they ran?
Come up with a solution for better communication and processes with the client, and suggest this as a learning. Everyone makes mistakes, so it could be nothing. Client could get pissy and request you move off the account. 
 Make a ppt with processes : who is responsible for what (google « RACI «  or « swimlanes »), with timings and retroplannings. Note every step. Identify the problem on your campaign and set a fix in your process (redundancy, validation,..)
Do checklists with every step valid for every campaign, print them on a board and use them. (Google « kanban board »). It will’decrease your error’rate.
Case studies and examples of success.
This is what was happening, then I did this because of these reasons and now this new better thing is happening.
I’ve documented my entire approach, process and philosophy for every aspect of digital marketing that I consider myself an expert in and tie it back to real world successes I’ve had. Why did I do all this work? Because it automates the process when I start a new project and have to work with my team to execute it.
Years ago while I was a student, I started a lifestyle website to tinker around with and was trying to learn through experience how to get more people to visit it. I got my first job because I was talking about this hobby website and what I was doing to market it to some random guy at a wedding and he connected me with someone who needed my skill set.
Start with WordPress. Buy a hosting plan and a domain. Try to rank it by using various methods such as SEM, SEO, PPC. If you like what you are doing, then take it from there. 
For example, Moz is an SEO platform so they have an article/ebook called "Beginners guide to SEO". They created this content to market their product and bring traffic to their website (content marketing) but the information is actually really useful and reliable. Many other sites have that sort of stuff too so keep an eye out.
Also, Google Analytics has a free course on how to use their platform that also goes over AdWords. That's specifically for the Google platform but it is probably a good place to start.
I've made a tutorial about how to start a website. Recommend buying a domain name. I've discussed it in the tutorial as well. Send me a message if you want to have the link. I'd post it here but I'm sure it will get removed. 
U could use weebly.com as ur website builder if u dont  want to pay a monthly fee. It's the best website if u want to do it for free. It also gives u a free domain but if u want a good one apart from weebly then I suggest greengeeks it cost 3.95$ per month which is great and it loads the fastest.
Start with this, install Wordpress locally using this software, and see if you can learn html, css, really basic PHP (you don’t need much for front end), and Bootstrap which is a html and css framework for easily building websites that are responsive (look good on both desktop and mobile).
If you build a website you like you can transfer it to a real hosting plan if you want to.
It sounds like you want to learn everything all at once, and it is not like that. What do you want to learn first?
But making ads and SEO and content etc that is some tougher stuff. But still videos all over the internet for that too.
- get some base pay and a budget
- get accurate financial info that shows the baseline 
I've been considering this as well. I've had a few rug businesses approach me looking for digital marketing help. They couldn't pay me my usual monthly fee, so they offered me 15-20% of all online sales. I'm still considering it, but I'm worried that the time sunk into building it won't pay off. But on the flip side, if things do take off, the commission from online sales would far exceed the usual rate I charge by 300-500%. 
Also if the product is available in store, you'll be my proxy pushing sales there too.
I run a small firm, and I do this for select businesses I believe in and people I really want to work with. The way to look at it is that you're effectively investing in the business. You're investing time and skills in the hopes of a future return, so you have to think about if the product/service and business are a good investment.
Some of my projects have been misses, but others have done well, and I did make more than I would have with just the standard fee. It took time, though, and I didn't really see much money for the first couple months.
I was thinking of posting this exact same thing! I run most of my ads thru AdeEspresso purely to avoid having to touch FB Ads. It's shit, it lags on my powerful laptop and Macbook Pro and often it just loads and loads and doesn't work. 
More than once I've had to extend client deadlines because the Ads Manager just stopped working for 24 hours. Support try to help but there's not a lot they can do. 
Just created a new campaign and ad set this afternoon. I noticed the images got lost when publishing but other than that it's fine.
3. Again - this all comes in content marketing. For instagram, this is where all the trick lies. For ex - i often use models in promoting my product. It creates good engagement and traffic to website. Same way - picturesque places do the same. And food. And memes. There are many. You need to to consider what brand image you want to give as well
4. Ads - can do many things. Depends on nature and what you want. Traffic flow to website, increasing likes, views and followers etc. Craft ad carefully. 
1. Set up a free business profile
Add information about your company, such as business hours, location and phone number.
The actions interval for the first 12-20 days after the account has been created is 36-48 seconds;
The total limit is 500 actions a day (follow, unfollow, like);
1. Hashtags will definitely help this as someone else stated. You can also detail target the audience you want to reach via Facebook Ad Manager (FB owns IG and you can set up ad campaigns for IG within FB). Will help keep your ad spend down, because you're only reaching certain people who are more likely to become clients/customers/etc.
Hope this helps! If you have any questions, feel free to ask!
I notice they aren’t clickable. Is there a way to make them clickable ?
I just organically like and message
Have a homework assignment due date coming up, I see.
If not then hire a graphics designer.
Make a fb and insta page. Start posting engaging content. Learn insta hacks how to increase followers. Once you get a good base of followers and decent profile - start with paid ads. They are worth it for apparel industry.
Programmatic for display, dynamic display, native, ctv, advanced TV and connected audio. 
What's your monthly budget? Have you considered an agency to run all of those platforms do you? 
You can refer various blogs and online tutorials by Neil Patel, HubSpot, Social Media Examiner and tons of such. It will help to understand the trends, you can also subscribe to these. Moreover I heard webware io provides all such services which can help your business reach people through digital medium. They can write blogs for you also create and maintain social media profiles for you and much more.
College is not pointless. Every single marketer I work with has a degree. Yeah you can do small time campaigns for some guy who owns a couple car washes but the big agencies and ad tech firms are recruiting college grads not DIYers. 
Hire somebody. Or dedicate 10 hours a day for 6 months in learning. 
It's amazing how people underestimate marketing. You want to succeed but won't spend resources on advertising? Is like wanting to run a f1 car but not hire a pro pilot
Hope it helps!

The 21 she tips help me to drive traffic to my blog #shoutquick
Let me know if you have any questions, more than happy to answer them.
No. Does he have a background in digital marketing? 
No. I go in person after doing due diligence. I go in, ask the person who looks like the gate keeper a lot of questions with tons of jargon and they usually get me someone with decision making authority. My close ratio is way better that way. 
I grew up as a party promoter and street hustler before social media and google. Pounding the pavement is something that gave me an advantage then, it gives me an advantage now. If you can’t get one person to commit in person, how can you realistically get a conversion online?
I hire digital marketers, and the number one thing I look for is quantifiable mentions. “Increased social media followership by X% while also growing post engagement from Y% to Z% in 10 months.”  “Increased PPC average quality score from X to Y and created Z% new leads from paid sources, which netted an incremental $XYZ in revenue in the first year.”  
Please stay away from things like: I'm 80% skilled in content marketing, vs 90% in SEO. That shit screams of stupidity in my mind.   
The BEST stats to include on your resume are things like: I executed a content marketing optimisation, adding 20% content to an existing 10k words, which increased organic traffic by 60% in three months. This involved xyz. That's much better and as digital marketing is largely data-driven, it shows you're aware of key metrics and so on, too.   
From a table like that you would be able to do a lot. Pretty much a tiny version of an analyst role. Make a pivot table with a calculated field to tell me which channel for mobile has the highest ctr and which has the highest conversion rate. 
I mod this sub, the other larger marketing related subs, and run our discord server. My experience, marketers don't spend a lot of time helping each other, maybe they're afraid to give out too much "special sauce" for free. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
Seems you're part of your own problem. As others have mentioned, that's why we are here too, but notice none of us have said "I'm here to provide content." Reddit has a weird hate for marketers pushing their products/ideas. Even in this sub I've seen the instant downvotes for a lot of content that is provided. There seems to be a fine line for content between desired helpful information and spammy self-serving blogs.
Good points...but where is backlink building?
I just finished my master in marketing and now want to get in to digital marketing. I have no experience in that field and the interviews i been to have basically rejected me because of that, even that i have a master in marketing from a good university.
Do u have any recommendations how i can get a job within digital marketing? Can i study it by myself? And what field within digital marketing exist and which one is the best for a long term and high salary?
The way wix generates pages is very JavaScript heavy, making it difficult to index. 
I would push very hard to get away from Wix, ignore the sunk costs.
Any specific area or just more generally? I know some in the music industry but they're specific to this 
We would really need to know more about this theoretical product. How much does it cost, what's the lifetime value of a customer, how much competition does it have in the market, etc, etc.

I'm new to this subreddit, but I've used a ton of tools for a ton of different things. We used Nanigans for Facebook and mobile display ads for our enterprise level accounts, and it's amazing, but it's really expensive. At my current company, we use AdEspresso, which is great for managing ads and has some light logic/optimization features, but nothing like Nanigans.
Does it work for long run?
Internal linking does help a bit, but not by much. You need to really build quality backlinks to you website to boost your rankings. On-page optimization can only get you so far.
PM me if you want to talk more about it
Others may differ, but in the UK I've found more success for me and my clients not with lead ads but creating an ad that directs to a landing page to capture lead information.  
When I've done A/B tests on this much higher conversion rates and lower CPL guiding to a landing page.  
In terms of asking for examples and the copy and the image, make it unique to YOU. Make it related to the pain points and struggles of your target audience and GIVE them something in exchange for their email. Don't expect loads of leads flooding in without giving them anything in return.  
But even more than that Facebook will have 'tagged you as 'relevant' for those sort of ads. So you can keep seeing the good, the bad and the fucking terrible on your feed.
It all depends on industry and buyer's persona. 
Do a/b testing. Keep doing what is working and keep tweaking what is not performing well.
As for design, you have to base this once again on the audience you want to show the ad to.  Do the psychological research on these interest groups and find out what that interest group is willing to click on.  Example: Interests groups related to coupons react really well to big buttons on the ad with price off or discount percentage with words like "limited time", "only while supplies last" with the product image in the background.  Hiring good designers is key to create engaging ads.
Printed media 
Online media
2. look for interesting media, look for successful newspapers, look for awful bad conspiracy shit (you need to know how bad job looks like)
5. after that - you need to know if it is worth it, yeah? So analyze it, yeah? How much visitor you have on your blog - so google academy, google analytics... SEO basics.
Dont do broad tutorials like: "Digital Marketing, master everything and be mega hero". No good. It is all about curiosity. 
Reddit has helped me a lot and has a ton of info about career paths, but if you need some resources, PM me and I will link you some :p
Google digital garage then just learn by doing!
Google Ad Words certificate is free and a good introduction to concepts
What do they like, how do they talk, creative guidelines.
Be aware that asking your client what they want is different than asking "what business problem do you need solved?" 
For example, a client who insisted they needed to get more website traffic actually needed to tweak the code on their shopping cart. They had the right amount of traffic but their website was impossible to use.  
Clients who are not marketing experts can accurately tell you the results they want, and need your help in figuring out how to achieve those results.
Figuring out what you want from the incoming people will help figure out where to look and how to bring them in.
FWIW one man musician operations aren't that unusual, with loopers and/or backing tracks you could certainly do something live. There are a ton of opportunities for amateur musicians to play so to eliminate that as an avenue of developing a reputation or following seems pretty short-sighted, to me. Those events cost you nothing but your time.

I was a CS major student back in the day, and got my first job as a marketing specialist in digital marketing, and moved to project management later. 
You don’t really learn digital marketing in school, so the major isn’t that important. In my company, the marketing department has to kinds of jobs. One is play with Facebook and/or google adwords accounts, which require experiences which you can get once you start your job. The other one is more like project management, you need to communicate with ppl a lot, and need to know all the things relate to digital marketing and  the project you are working on. 
From my experience, ppl majoring in CS, math and statistics may even have an advantage sometime. 
I’m not sure if I answers your question. Can me if you want to know more.
Digital marketing has become far easier in the last 5 years, from when I started you 100% needed to understand coding. These days you only need a digital marketing platform. 
I mayors in marketing and just got my first full-time job in digital marketing a month ago for a Ecommerce startup. For starters, knowledge in CS and statistics help alot in number-crunching and differentiating good and bad KPIs in FB business, GA, Google ads. The last digital marketer before me was in such sense and her previous campaigns was efficient with many metrics that she tested and compared. 
I have been doing paid search for 4 years. Research this carefully before you choose this career path. If you go work for an agency (which is where most of the work is) you may have a heavy workload, long nights, terrible employers, bad benefits, bad pay etc. You are not going to make good money unless you become a director $100k+ or somehow figure out how to make a % of the client's media spend.
Doing SEO is a precarious situation because it's difficult to prove the worth of SEO unlike with paid search.
Paid search is difficult because you're dealing with other people's money. So they want to see a really good return on their investment while combating so many issues like rising cpcs.
My colleagues who do programmatic think it's difficult getting quick decisions, all the digital assets quickly and ever shifting demands.
Front end coding/tracking/test setup is light work in the coding world, but combining it with marketing knowledge and tactics can make it a powerful hybrid roll.
Downside is that many jobs are at agencies, and not all companies actively test.
Just a thought. It is how I salvaged a really weird life path, lol.
I use it myself. Gave Access to my VA, and he's building links for me based on the guides.
I am a digital marketer in LA. Recently moved here from Austin. I work with the big film and tv studios and its big business. Its good work.
job opportunity? the COL is too high though and the place is a hellhole of degeneracy. if you value your soul, stay away
A working marketer looking to move. Remotely consulting for a firm at the moment. 
Thanks for the replies, everyone. I need to convince my manager why there’s pros for me to move to our offices in LA. Anything beneficial? 
***Job opportunity****? Although the call is too high it is also good on everything else*
Keep in mind that 90% of such courses are nothing but regurgitated basics from the original sources. True experts also do offer paid courses which usually cost much more but contain useful well-structured tips and a lot of practice. I suggest completing courses by Google first and then keeping an eye on real pros (not random $50 courses) who share info for free. Before paying for any course conduct a research (ask people for real reviews, ) and take another month to decide.
Forget udemy - pay proper money for a proper course from someone who is currently doing it well (i.e Cat Howell, Tim Burd...)
Definitely get the certs, they're easy and (in my opinion) more valuable to a potential employer at this level than a marketing degree. 
I cut my teeth being a co-ordinator. It's a good entry level role. You can go for big agencies where it will be more gruelling and competitive but possibly teach you at a higher level, or you can go for small agencies and learn how to do lots of different types of marketing at once.
If your sites have Good Analytics...you can setup alerts for when traffic drops as one way to monitor things.
I use UptimeRobot on the web. Has a free and paid version.
ManageWP is dirt cheap for all it does. Highly highly recommend. Non intrusive, no headaches, just runs in the background and you don’t have to worry about it (until you need it). 
I’m not nearly as good at taking eye breaks as I should be, but I get up and walk around for ten minutes or so every couple of hours.
Expect to be exhausted while your health declines at an ever increasing rate.
I don't have to do much graphic work now so I have nightshift enabled all the time, just enough to caught the blue, and I'm constantly adjusting brightness depending on what I'm looking at (on a laptop) and I feel that for me, it's made a huge difference in eye strain. 
Wow! That question really made me think. At least 12 hours including my smartphone. 
All day, every day. Other than meetings (average of 2 hours / day) all my work is done on a laptop. We are also paperless, so no trips to the printer.
FWIW, I’ve never experienced eye fatigue or any symptom linked to staring at screens all day. Just keep your screen brightness in the sweet spot and use night shift on your devices to limit your nighttime exposure to blue light.
 I also do regular exercises to keep my posture in good shape since it’s nearly impossible for me to sit properly all day (I’m a fidgeter).
I use a standing desk at work 9-5 at an agency. It makes it easy to step away and having spent 40 hours a week for years sitting and staring at a screen, I can confidently say standing makes a huge difference.
From around 8am through to about 11-12pm. Probably 4-5 hours away from the computer during that time.
On average probably 4 hours a day, the rest are meetings.
Wear blue light blocking glasses. Problem almost entirely solved
at least 6 to 7. I try to take breaks for walking and lunch for sure
I would just use a spreadsheet, seems the quickest and less cumbersome solution.
I use a spreadsheet every week to show my team
Our Marketing analytics. I just can pull up a few weeks worth of data and apply to there ... 
Oh how we all would love data back from the platforms you listed...
Unfortunately when running Facebook ads driving to iTunes, Amazon, and Google you lose the ability to track users. These platforms are what are called “walled gardens” and do not allow for any tracking from visitors of ads outside of their own ads. 
Create your own Business Manager and request admin access to that page. From what I know it doesn't matter if it's connected to another Business Manager.
P.S. I need to let this out somewhere too and your post was a trigger. 
That’s up to the customer. It’s all relative.
$2500 for a website seems very cheap. 
I agree that it’s all relative. Consider the client’s financial capacity and their business profitability after the website is done. Will the business grow exponentially after the website is launched?
It depends on the size of business/amount of work. A blog set up for an amateur photographer might be a few hundred bucks. A website for a very large business would be very way beyond the $2K mark, especially if they are hiring writers to write copy for hundreds of pages and doing SEO work. I know those are two extremes and you likely fall into neither, but I think you have a fair quote. 
Honestly, pricing is up to you and how your client perceives your value. If you can justify your pay package then its is never too much. It's definitely dependent on each client and how much they are willing to pay. Though you must be able to deliver the value that you have promised for the client's satisfaction. How you handle yourself will determine referrals and your value. So its never too much as long as you can justify it. A luxury good is lucrative due to its high demand and high price. If you fix yourself to a price you are only worth that much. You should get more expensive as you offer more. Maybe you can offer a price range, but ALWAYS be 100% open to negotiations.
We have lots of web dev agency where we are based with different pricing the most expensive start at 4K and turn down work at anything less but they fully bespoke everything other company’s will do a theme and quick job from £99 
The monthly sound expensive to me. What are you doing for that? 
Im my great at copywriting. I just pull up the competitors' ads and take ideas from there. I can make copy better, but can't write from scratch. 
Use manual CPC bidding if you have a limited budget and set google conversion tracking tag on your site, it will help you amend your campaign easily.
To put it into context, my DSA campaigns outperform any of my other TCPA campaigns in terms of CR, and CTR. 
All you got to do is make sure the search term matches the copy/landing page. 
Get a basic grasp, understand what competitors and similar businesses do then test and learn
Yes, it's apart of the skillset a marketer has. Some of these comments saying no, is like saying no, understanding boxing principles and tactics don't help in MMA. Of course, though you want to see what works from competitors and test. However, understanding principles within copywriting will help you as a marketer as you'll be able to utilize persuasion to entice potential consumers to buy. 
You don't have to but copy writing principles do help your ad stand out a little
No, not really.
stop by the next chamber of commerce meeting in your area, speak to some of the business owners about their digital marketing.  maybe it could lead to a few projects depending on their needs
Somehow choose the best CMS platform is difficult because every CMS having its own limitation and requires expertise. There are many platforms are available but only few the best that are following: 
BigCommerce is cloud-based CMS platform which is user-friendly and allow to build beautiful, responsive web store without any design knowledge. You can get 15 days of Free trial from BC. 
Volusion is another best e-Commerce CMS platform that provides cloud-based solution to users. Volusion has come up with many features like “deal of day” Amazon and eBay integration that will help to retain customers and build brands.  You can get 14 days of Free trial from BC. 
OpenCart is a light weight CMS platform for eCommerce, which is free for use and upgrade. OpenCart is best option for newbie that have some basic knowledge and experience in web designing and development. OpenCart features unlimited categories, products, and manufacturers, Multilingual, PCI Compliant, more than 20 payment gateways, reporting and more.
If you want a good, functional, and cheap CMS, then Hubspot is pretty good. I use the free version for my small business.
Shopify is garbage; I'm not sure why so many people use it. I generally avoid companies that offer "done for you" solutions.
Are you planning on using paid media to drive traffic at any time in the near future?
How much traffic do you get/expect in a week?
What advanced e-commerce tools do you want to use (suggested products, cart abandonment recovery etc.)?
What technology is your business on that your e-commerce needs to integrate with?
Once you answer these questions you can look at the features and offerings of e-commerce platforms and choose which one fits best with what you are looking to do.
Everyone is listing ecommerce platforms instead of CMS platforms. Ecommerce platforms should only handle the product catalog, on-site search, and checkout functions.
**Why is engagement so low compared to their followers?**  
From my understanding, Facebook is largely pay-to-play these days. Don't get me wrong, there are some companies that have exceedingly loyal followers that actively seek out and engage with their content. However, it has become harder and harder for business's to have their content be organically visible. Pages with 100k+ followers often get 1-4 likes because no one even sees their content due to the FB algorithm. 
**Does social media affect sales?**  
Yes, if a company goes all in. Social media is a requirement for most companies in a PR and customer-service standpoint. But social-media requires a lot of work and follow-through engagement to affect sales, and some businesses are better suited for social-media sales strategies. Think food, outdoor activities, fashion, aka anything visual with emotional appeal. 
I'm currently launching a new business and all of my competitors with 1000s of followers post articles daily on social media - to me they look high quality and relevant to our target audience. But they get fuck all engagement, a bare handful of likes, no comments, minimal shares. I don't get it.
Simple: Hire a proper sales team, forego inefficient marketing mediums in industries where it does not provide any real value. Brand equity comes from engagement with the brand, regardless of medium.
To find that out, analyzing the channels which are converting most people can help. As far as the low engagement of social media is concerned, are all those likes/followers organic? Also, does the brand engage with the followers? Third, does the brand engage with others' content?
If they don’t shoot it themselves and if their brands are very visual, I would source a local production company to do the photos according to a breif. 
I havr the same question, please help
SEMRush is good. I like it. 
It depends on what you want to use it for. If you need it for keyword research, SEO studies, keyword position tracking, SEO competitor data, Adwords competitor data, graphic design & editing, social media tracking and posting, and automated reports, brand monitoring, then Semrush is fantastic. 
SEMrush is one good tool you can have but also you can try for Ahrefs, SimilarWeb, Moz Pro, Buzzsumo. these tools I have tried and even they are good to have for Digital Marketing.
I love it. It's my go-to tool for competitive research and generating ad ideas. 
I’d like to know this. I’m trying to bring this to my agency in the US and wondering what levers they are pulling for me 
So basically $2-55 CPM
I have tried several different instagram bots and services. The one that best for me is BigBangram.com, service with auto likes and followers, free proxy, scheduled posting, multiple accounts adn so on. Of course i can't use them all, but it nice to have some extra stuff included. This service was best solution for my instgram acc.
I am using a follow/unfollow bot for Instagram free (a cracked version). It also allows you to do others tasks but those are the main functions I've been using. It's called Instadub Pro
Honestly, my blunt answer would be, "They both have people on them, who do you want to sell to?"
Just selling "toothpaste" to anyone who might want it will drive you broke quickly.  Figure out a target audience, figure out a USP, opportunities for behaviour change, potential attitude changes...
Once you've figured that out, demographics (e.g. audience size metrics you can estimate on each channel) might tell you which one is better.
That would be my strategy anyway.
I'd really recommend you don't spread your budget too thin trying to do a lot at once, if you have small budgets keep it really focused as a lot of bidding algorithms and even manual optimisation needs data to perform so focus on one thing to start with. 
Both, plus Bing, plus Instagram, plus display, retargeting for all of the above plus shopping campaigns. 
Both worth testing. What about Amazon? 
On either platform, you will end up paying at least $.50 per click, if not substantially more. With the average e-commerce conversion rate for paid search being 3.75% this means you will be acquiring new customers at a cost of $12.50 per purchase.
I suspect that such a sub-reddit will be filled with ads
Why not build a client base the old fashioned way?  Case studies
I'd like to know that too...
Use Reddit Ads. Spamming doesn't work.
Search Engine Optimization is a little bit more complicated - you must develop a broader skillset, more difficult to get it right in a year.
By far Ahrefs!  And Ahrefs is not only a backlink checking tool.
* Increase keyword lists to find new keyword ideas.
You can try Moz’s Keyword Explorer. Also you can check out Keyword Shitter. If you don’t want Google Keyword planner there’s another tool from Google called Google Correlate. It finds search patterns which correspond with real‐world trends. 
In my opinion, Google keyword planner tool is the best
Keyword planer is best tool for keyword researching
What I will say, it’s currently an all out block on Facebook and Google. They’re so strict it hasn’t been worth risking blatant disregard. From a quick search you can see the different strategies being employed from major players. 
You’re in the right market!
I have been doing some digital marketing for a vape company in UK.
As a publisher/Agency we created cannabis websites to be able to advertise for cannabis/cbd companies.
Fb, Google and Bing won't allow it on their network. 
What country are you in ? I see ads on google and fb constantly for cbd here in europe. Both from dutch, danish, seeish and british sites all triggered on cbd keywords with cbd oil/paste/vape in the headlines and their remarketing following me on fb/insta. 
Seems rather easy. 
Part 1. Current picture. 
d1) page engagement 
I’d also like to know this ^
SEMrush is a great tool to identify the keywords and on which keywords your competitors are ranking. And also, integrating with google analytics is must to know real traffic on your website.
Do not do this lol. Invest in yourself. Build a portfolio. Try to snag a few small businesses in your area, and learn as you go. I know that isn't the answer you want to hear, but it's necessary to land a real job in this industry.
Google analytics has a free training program, Udemy has cheap copywriting, strategy, marketing courses. Save that cash.
Of course the only REAL way to learn is by DOING but I highly recommend learning from someone to avoid mistakes.
Do you want do to corporate? Then just go work for someone for free and use the $10k to support yourself.
For myself, I chose the corporate/start-up route because my entrepreneurial endeavors failed lol... and I decided to work with someone that scaled 3 businesses to 7-figres using Digital Marketing (Funnel building and traffic.).   
I've done it over 5 months so far and because of it I currently manage like $30k per month on FB Ad spend, in charge of email marketing/follow-up, take control of our launches, and do a lot of really cool stuff... plus these are skills that are in-demand.. i mean what business owner wouldn't want a system that brings in more money through online marketing? 
It's also lead me to having access to Dan Henry's course (which seems super basic to me now) & Sam Oven's course but I can use some of the principles to make myself a ton of $$.  
\-If you're not, find someone to learn from thats done/doing big things and work for free.
Learn how to drive traffic. 
Digital Marketing is all about experience.
There are plenty of excellent free resources that can get you started, but there's nothing that motivates you to learn specific things than putting your own dang money on the line.
None.  Get a bachelors degree
I’m in b2b saas and it’s primarily paid search. 90% AdWords and 10% bing. And about 20% of my monthly budget goes to review websites to generate leads from users comparing our solution to our competitors. 
I've been testing a new flow which my clients are now asking me to do for them. Lead gathering through [seamless.ai](http://seamless.ai), LinkedIn Sales Navigator, or Autoklose then automated email outreach via Autoklose. I track clicks to Calendly and my site via google analytics campaigns. Some emails have video, others have whitepapers or targeted links. 
It's new for me but has been working. I get 3-5 meeting requests per day and have been managing the process for a lawyer and some other clients at $1,250/ month. Better than the people trying to sell me on LinkedIn outreach for $1,500/ month. I never click those messages, why would I pay you to send them. lol
SEM, paid social, and predictive marketing via Rocket Fuel. Occasionally experiment with in-person events and email list purchasing, but they're generally not worth the time or money.
Facebook’s algorithms strongly prefer to show content from close friends instead of businesses these days.
Only way to get past this without sponsoring posts is to have either super high engagement posts (if someone regularly engages, they’re more likely to see future posts organically), or by asking users to get notifications when a page posts OR asking them to set your page to “see first”.
Win-win for Facebook, not so much for businesses. 
Obviously you can still do well on there, but it's gotten a lot harder over the years. Perhaps they did well a few years ago and their reach has suffered, but their marketing team just keeps going anyway. It happens. 
There's honestly any number of reasons why. Don't assume they've cheated by buying followers though.
Boosting is junk DO NOT do that.
If they have such low interactions might mean that their followers are fake.
And that is only for Likes. Organic Sharing rates are even lower. 
Pages with 10,000 + fans or followers have much bigger organic response rates. 
Lots of people buy fake followers, not understanding that they need at least a 2% engagement rate if they want Facebook's Edgerank algo to organically show posts to followers.
If your engagement rate drops below 2%, then you end up in a downward spiral.
Paying for followers means you'll need to also continuously pay for engagement.
Facebook is getting so good at targeting now it just needs a little helping hand. Give it one or two interests and a rough idea of age and geo. It is amazing how well it can learn from there and hone in on your ideal audience. Often too much detail in interests will increase the cost as you are giving fb a smaller audience to go at. That’s step 1.... 
Try to use video when possible. But make sure it’s a good video. Facebook also now gives you an option to make a slideshow ad within their platform which is basically a low grade video. Check it out when you are in the ad level. 
A good conversion rate is totally relevant to the industry and what you’re trying to do. If this is your first test, let this help establish the benchmark. 
I recommended this before and it seemed to help a similar ask, helped me figure out pricing too. https://www.freshbooks.com/assets/other/Breaking-the-Time-Barrier.pdf
I've done freelance for years. My advice, shoot for a monthly budget so you have steady hours and pay. Your rate should depend upon your skills and experience. Also consider self employment tax. I would target at min $100 / hour and more like $200. If there is pushback just point out you are cheaper and better than agencies.
Since you have no experience, please charge a reasonable amount and then gradually increase it.
I was under the impression that you earned the certification after you complete the fundamentals course plus one more. (Source: I just did it yesterday and got the certificate). 
As a digital agency, we do look for google ad certifications in our candidates, meaning one has completed the fundamentals plus one of the specialitations. It proves that you put the effort into passing the exams and you have the basic knowledge. Also, it is mandatory for businesses to have a certain amount of certified employees to achive the status of being a google partner business.
Word of advice: don’t try to find the easy way out. If you really want digital marketing to work for you, learn it. Take a few courses. It’ll pay off. 
Well maybe I'm just a quack marketer 
There are some research tools like ComScore or Nielsen which help you identify where your target audience is online. I don't think there isn't one tool that would develop a whole campaign strategy, that is what your clients are hiring you for! Do some target market research and develop a strategy that makes sense based on the campaign goals, budget and target. There are lots of resources online that can help with digital marketing strategy. 
How to drive traffic from blogs #shoutquick
To track the users, view demographics and many more things you can use Google Analytics. If you have a gmail account then add your business to google analytics and then you’ll be able to get analytics on all the stuff related to users, geography, time they spent on your website and many more.  
Dropmock has tons video templates 
Crello graphic editor has hundreds of predesigned animated and video templates - just rolled out a major update in August. Requires a PRO account.
And I don't think there is one product cover "all in one" But you can find tools that compatible with each others
You can Google Wordpress landing page theme and plugin to view a list of the available products. Try the demo in both desktops and mobile. Because some theme that claim mobile friendly can look real awful. 
I would suggest you to try Leadsquared. Amazing tool with amazing features.
I don’t yet have the bandwidth to test this but if anyone else tries it, I’d love to read your experience here. 
GREAT JOB! Thank you for creating, i thought doing it in excel was fine but this is next level ease :)
This is great. I hate doing this manually in Excel.
Test test test though. Break out each of your interest into their own ad sets. Even further break down age groups into ad sets. Dump a solid budget amount into the first 2-3 days to see what is working and turn off the ones that aren't.
18-45 is a bit too broad, especially for 80s-90s nostalgia event. 18 year olds were not even born then, so they have nothing to be nostalgic about :) I would do something along the lines of 25-50, and target, for instance, artists that were popular back then.
I've been doing digital marketing for over 5 years and took the high level approach, which has led me to my current position as the digital marketing director for a SaaS company. I got my start as an in-house digital marketing specialist managing the digital analytics (GA certification), SEO, social (Facebook blueprint), and paid search accounts (Google partners certification, Bing Ads certification) for a sizeable eCommerce company. I continued to learn and expand my skill set into things like programmatic, UX design, account-based marketing (ABM certified strategist), marketing automation (Marketo/Pardot certifications), among others. Earning a few of those certifications for those programs where I could. 
Hubspot academy 
I would suggest getting Inbound Marketing certified. It's free to do with HubSpot. Learn everything you can about lead generation and customer-centric marketing. You'll find your niche in time, but you want to know how the machine works.
How it started for me?
I graduated in Corporate Finance, didn’t want to work in the field and decided to find a job in marketing (no specifics at first) but everyone kept coming back and telling how my degree is an obstacle in the way.
Some months later I met old classmates that were launching a startup and needed some kinda CTO (but they needed something like an all rounder), working with them for a year and half paved the way for the digital creative agency I’m working for today.
Almost a year now
Subscribed to a TON of newsletters and followed Twitter accounts. 
I was taken under an SEO-guy's wing. Laid off after 16 months. Salty about it.
Then I tried to sell merchant processing services for a few months. Bad at it.
Then I tried to sell Wordpress & SEO packages. Bad at it.
Went to night school for Lean Six Sigma certificate.
Then worked as a campaign manager for a black-hat affiliate network for 1yr. Felt bad about it.
Went to a JS coding bootcamp. Loved it, expensive tho.
Then I got a job at a legit programmatic agency. Paid well, at 1yr took a cut to work 3 days/wk.
Now I'm doing their performance dashboards 3 days/wk, getting a masters degree the other 4 days.
As a generalist in 2000. The web was weird, nerdy, online advertising was a 486pixel banner. 
Started as a generalist, basically I was just okay at every digital marketing function. "wearer of serveral hats" but not great at any one thing. One advantage is that it's great to get a sense of what your strengths and weaknesses are. Now I specialize in e-mail marketer, which I enjoy a lot more than having my hands in everything. 
I started as a generalist from email marketing, content marketing, and social media marketing. This was about 8+ years ago before it was a thing. I am still a generalist but focus more on strategy now instead of execution. I do miss the specialization side sometimes. 
My start was related to web analytics jobs since I was a database analyst. Then I discovered the digital marketing “world” and got into PPC and SEO courses.
Specialist. Just a few months in paid social - Facebook specifically. Although I do help with SEM marketing from time to time. I love SEM but learning more about Facebook marketing has been rewarding so far.
Great idea, the current groups are just full of spam these days. Funnily enough I left almost all of them recently.
I’m in the process of launching a group around local business marketing for the same reasons so maybe we could bounce some ideas around as to what’s working etc...
What’s the name so I can search. Having problem with link but sure it’s just my phone
Do you allow posting.?
We are ready to bang it..! 
Hubspot will do precisely what you are asking with a lot of additional features for Inbound Marketing.  The free version only allows 5 email templates but the upgrade is well worth the investment.  It even integrates with Mailchimp!
You are screwed :-)
This was all kind of "stream of consciousness", but take the long weekend to think about what your organization actually does, not what they say they do in their marketing materials, but where they are really good.  Take that, and build an offering from there.
Holy shit. I'm in the exact reverse situation. I'm a sales guy who's making the leap into starting a digital marketing agency. Where are you located? PM me OP and I'll let you have a crack at the models I used.
I agree that true sales professionals don't come across as what the stereotype portrays: sleezy, used car salesmen, that are pushy and don't take no for an answer.  Now, it's true that a salesman will ask for the sale, but it's not until you've taken time to ask questions about your potential client to see where there pain points are, how they run their business, and where their gaps are.  After you've taken catalogue of this data (mentally or physically jotting it down) you return with how your product or process actually addresses these issues, but more importantly, you explain the benefits in the same terms that they expressed their concerns.  This way you align your solution to their specific problem.  So, in reality, true salespeople are only solving problems.  But they do so by asking the right questions and presenting a solution to those problems with a customer tailored response.  
Understand what each social channel is for and how to use them. There's loads of blogs on this so google is your friend. You will probably have to pay to get the reach you want but it is possible to do it for free (just takes a lot longer).
Edit: hubspot also do some free courses. I've not done them yet but that might also be worth a look :)
Email marketing has a low return. The effort & cost would be huge to ensure a continually demographically accurate database. So I'll just bulk send an offer to a crap shoot of emails and see what happens - but I don't care, the revenue is elsewhere 
There are many free ways to get traffic to your website. 
I would always go for industry specific forums and sites and develop your thought leadership. Like Reddit find all the subreddits that are relevant to your industry and try and establish a presence for you as individuals. 
Create a challenge for your industry, and leverage talents who want to shine in the limelight to promote your business. You can give away your product/service as a prize. Or a small prize, they would do it for the recognition. 
Partnerships are free, find an organisation that would like to partner with you, but is not in direct competition, and would like access to your mailing list. Have them sponsor a prize, that you give when you host a challenge. 
Well, just a few tips that'll help.  You may not get massive results, but this could be a good starting point:
Content marketing on its own is completely useless, by that I mean without paid traffic it can take very long to gain a bit of traction.
SEO is also completely useless...
3. **Create a press release that offers value to media outlets, so they get her on the radio/TV or in the paper.** Usually something of value is something the company can do the contribute to others.
5. Pick up that plastic piece of shit we call a phone.
IMHO, she would consider an effective inbound marketing strategy, think about content, a blog, white papers and so on, make your website filled with enough articles to attract people, post stuff in daily basis even many times a day and I can help for that with no charges(let's discuss this in private)
Sounds to me like it's all about the organic traffic for you:
Make sure your site content is well keyworded (note that this means quality not quantity).
Refferal - See if you can get listed on some other relevant sites that do get traffic. If you're a cool startup there's a chance reaching out to tech blogs etc could work.
Social - Pick a few social platforms and post to them religiously. FB and Twitter might be best for traffic. Use relevant hashtags, run completions to grow your audience etc.
While it seems like fighting an uphill battle, SEO can still be done but requires much effort. It is executed mostly by performing tasks such as setting up fake websites, creating artificial links, building of keyword-laced landing pages for specific keywords and tags.
The best way to genuinely increase a websites ranking is to ensure the website has good security (SSL certificates); interesting, well written and formatted content; relevant and considered information. 
Good luck and remember: Most digital marketers are just winging it, even a basic understanding will allow you to pretty much make it up as you go along.
2) One of the mistakes newbies do is related to site indexing. And, because of this, Google is not able to find and crawl their sites. In that case, all the efforts you put in for SEO go waste.
And, the list goes on. But, the above mention point are good to drive 8–10k traffic a month to your blog (I have done all these and getting 8.3K traffic per month).
Not quite a direct answer, but... 
Avoid the superstars : Seth Godin, Brian  Solis, Neil Patel and so on. All know what they are talking get about but won't teach you anything practical. I'd go niche. Have a look at sites like PPC Hero, Search engine Watch, Econsultancy (disclaimer - I worked for them a while ago) etc and follow their individual bloggers. Also check out twitter chats like #ecomchat and see who answers there. Some really good people with a focus on 'helping you do your job better", rather than 'selling you their new book'.
I'm not an industry 'expert', though. I really like AdWeek's social media section, and I follow writers like Lauren Johnson and Chris Heine.
15 Influential Digital Marketing Educators You Should Follow
I did the idm professional diploma. It was ok but not sure I'd recommend it. It was very unorganised. 
I use Feedly app to get the digital marketing news on daily basis. I've subscribed to numerous blogs including backlinko, hubspot, marketingProfs daily, Moz Blog, Semrush Blog, Copyblogger, Mashable, Seth Godin and many more. 
Feedly is one of the best ways to get all updates at one place.
Otherwise, you may also subscribe to the newsletters of these blogs to get the regular updates from the directly to your inbox.
Did you find a list from 2015 and change the year?
Not all media is created equal and come on...most of this is so repetitive, mobile, PPC? Video? Sponsored content?
As someone with a marketing background its more pillow talk to give agencies a pat on their backs.  Agencies will recommend wearables to their clients and I guarantee it will get cut bc nobody wants to take risk on something that wont  convert, unless they are targeting that specific market.  The reality is that most clients Do not have enough ad budget to take risks.  And why should they just so the agency can go to Cannes? 
 Video will not come into its own until the NFL agrees to stream live content beyond games in London (which I hear might happen in 2017).  When the cost of a 60-second spot becomes cheaper than video... 
The reality is that TV and what we call "traditional media" isnt going away anytime soon.   What is good for marketers is that those mediums are more cost efficient and that there plans are comprehensive touch points to the target market. 
The most straight forward way to do this would be by using Hubspot but unfortunately is also the most expensive way of doing it. 
I use an RSS feed to keep up with websites on a daily basis, and I use Twitter and Instagram as a ‘fun’ way to consume whatever brain and eye candy is posted.
Tread carefully though, if you are employed full time you might struggle dealing with your own clients. What happens when a client wants to discuss something while you're at work or you need to edit a campaign? I can't see your current employer letting you freelance on the side.
Networking. Reaching out. Offering services.
Then there is also, fiverr, upwork.
You can use google my business app to find local business as well.
Moreover, carry a personality that people trust. More often than not, people want a digital marketing consultant. Lots of business owners will automatically want to connect with you and if you impress them enough, you might be hired. 
Also make sure your contract doesn't include a non-competitor clause/find out if your work culture prohibits that kind of thing. Last thing you want is to lose your job while trying to brand out.
In my company, we had a similar situation. Despite the fact that we are a digital marketing company, we have applied a person who had nothing to do with marketing and was working in the film industry before. But this fact helped her to develop a really brave campaign for our platforms. Now it works perfectly.  
Also spending budget efficienctly is a good point.  The reason people do DM is to cut down budget.  Remind the company that it's easier to spend money wisely and try out multiple campaigns in the same budget and not reduce it.  
Apologies if this all sounds obvious, but this is how I would approach it. 1. Step back into what purpose the site *is* supposed to be serving, not everything is transactional. 2. Consider who is likely to benefit and seek to know more about that. 3. What questions will they have that the site can answer or connect to. Then the usual google trends, search console and competitor analysis.
I did a sure for a large insurance company that doesn't want direct traffic because they seem through local agents, but then I showed them how we can direct traffic to their local agent network and they were floored.
Since it is a bot - it's not that it's targeting especially you - it just follows his algorithm of targeting accounts, and you maybe pop up because of one of the reasons mentioned above.
Try Udemy or Lynda for digital marketing courses. when you buy Udemy courses, make sure you wait for the discount 'season' (which is ever 2 weeks and gives you 90% off lol). not sure if that applies for lynda too though.  
but yeah hubspot and GA work well as a base too. get the GAIQ certification while you're at it.
Thank you, guys! This helps!
I think there are no analysis and statistical software that provides insights for Whatsapp. Whatsapp Marketing is great as it helps you reach many individuals at no cost. But you can't understand to whom it have been to and whom not. Like Hubspot and others software provide services etc.
You don't need Digital Sales course to become Google Ads Certified. Not a bad idea to have that certification though
I have not had experience personally with this model, but some thoughts:
If I was given enough control and visibility I’d consider it. The goal CPL would have to be reasonable enough. I’d forecast the cost per click, expected conversion rate, add my desired margin and if the math works, go for it. If the target cpl is too low for me to make money I’d pass.
You have to set your contract up to get paid on results if you want to make the most money, only do this if you really are good. 
Think of it from a financial POV. They want to know what they are spending their money on, the better the numbers sound mixed with low risk value, ( commission based ) 
Are they looking to get a bunch of cheap leads? 
You can come up with meaningful, and 'good looking' pricing plans for any of those approaches. You could surely generate a ton of clicks, and charge them a good rate for it, and laugh all the way to the bank. But those clicks would likely be poor quality and not turn into revenue for your client. You could charge them the same per lead as you would per click, and work really hard and go broke trying to make your client happy. Or you could find a way to meet in the middle and have a good long term working relationship, but find you may never reach agreement on metrics and price. 
It's bad practice, don't devalue the service itself. 
Yes it is possible.. depends on your capacity to learn and grab.. you can refer some YouTube videos and blogs which focus on blueprint exams.. you can find sample questions on internet if you do little search.. i think the whole course is divided into little modules.. and each module has seperate exam and certificate.. so you can achieve them one by one...
Yes, it is possible but you have to put your time and efforts in Facebook Blueprint. Then you will be able to take the test with 1 or 2 weeks.
Where are you now that there aren’t any openings? PPC is red hot. Any major city will have it. If you love the idea of NYC then go for it, although you’ll probably have to pay your way there. There are other much cheaper major cities that would work just as well. 
Exact same situation here. Really struggling to find a position doing PPC. I'm in Melbourne, Australia. Applying for 'Marketing Coordinator' jobs as well but haven't got an interview for any, seems like it's tough at the moment.
If you have to ask without doing a shred of independent research beforehand, I don’t think digital marketing is for you. The whole industry is about research with trial and error.
Research. If you can't find answers on your own, you're in the wrong business. 
Digital Marketing is a vast field and you cant just master all of it you need to figure out first which part of digital marketing you are focusing on. Let me list down some of them below  
I would maybe see what it all includes and then start with one topic. For example there is social media, social media marketing, seo, sem, content marketing and so much more...
How would you rank yourself? by making content about trending topics you will get ranked on google in no time literally now it's up to you how you manage to make content about trending topics
Using linkedin , Search engine Land, Search Engine journal.. It's very useful to you.
Well if you have the skills for it, even more if you have experience with what you want to do, there really isn't anything between you and a job. 
Two, find clients. You can for example target prospects you ll like to work for. Audit their actions (website, fb page, seo ranking,...), find quick wins and long term improvements, then make them an offer they can t refuse.
Upwork. Build your portfolio and chops at the same time.
You have to know WHICH problem you want to solve first. 
Learn how to solve just one for the moment, get some results and then show prospects your results. 
Flip this example on to health care, there are tons of subs that are specific to health conditions and communities to help people connect with others to better live with their condition. People don’t as openly talk about their health on other social media, especially not long form. 
Lol I could go on. I work with tech that uses reddit data and I think it’s super super valuable and a super rich data set , it’s just about how you frame your query and what you’re hoping to answer. 
It doesn’t have to be more valuable; most sites use data aggregators anyway so reddit will have access to much of the same data as google/Facebook.  It’s just a different option and when prices appropriately it works.
Reddit users are the least valued social users 
Reddit users are quite different than other social media players. 
When i was working at an agency i used mailchimp too and my first tests were going to the junk too.
2. The subject line
just try to play with those and see how the tests are being handled.
First, let me address some of the most common reasons why an email could land in the un-friendly zone, aka, spam.
If your IP Address was used for spam in the past, this could choke your current email metrics as well.
Mailbox providers weigh in this aspect as well during their spam filtering process.
Try not sending emails to dormant email accounts- emails that have not been active for a long time.
Don’t promise the stars in your subject line. Be genuine!
I’d still recommend not to send Bulk emails. Batch and Blast is a bad idea.
Try segmenting your email lists to make it smaller, and cleaner.
Another such tool is called e-Campaign. It  is a full featured mass Email tool.
Hope that helps!
Thrid.. 100/150 bounces means you obviously bought some shitty list that was old or scraped. Stop that. This is a business so treat it that way. Either start building your own list or buy a quality list from a reputable seller.
Spam on what provider? Gmail will inevitably end up in promotions. Either way, don’t worry. People check “spam” regardless of it being a filter just to make sure they didn’t miss anything. If it’s worthwhile, they will see it. 
If you’re looking for a way into the industry while having little to no experience in digital, having a GA or AdWords certification goes a long way in demonstrating that you have interest and that you’ve taken concrete steps towards it.
You can show it in interview time, but according to me its just a certificate that a passed the analytics exam,
Displaying that you have nothing better to do with your "digital marketing skills" but take BS tests as if you were still in high school.
You'd probably want to have further variations ready for testing.
Optimizing the campaign as such depends on how much volume you can afford for the test.
If whoever is managing your AW isn't doing this in some form, fire him and get someone who is.  
It depends. What's the budget? Selection of keywords?  How many variations of copy? What's already been done in terms of campaign setup?  It can range anywhere from a few minutes to days based on what's already been done vs starting from scratch, as well as the size and scope of the business. 
~~If it is on the Display network then it can take up to 3 days \[under review\]~~
Starting from scratch can take some time to ensure you have everything set correctly with good ad copy. 
To create a campaign, one ad group with keywords and 3 text ads could take less than 20 minutes. Maybe longer to think about better ad copy.

A few questions to help figure this out: 
you can also send DM messages to them and invite them to your page.
there are some tools you can use to automatically do this stuff and help you find customers on IG. you can try them if interested.
what about getting a Google Analytics certification?
Happy to help out :) Send me a PM ! 
Feel free to send me a message. I'm a marketing manager in the software industry. I also own a marketing blog. 
If I was the hiring manager I’d care more about how applying a % your focus on Bing improved outcomes for the business.  If you can prove doing so increased audience, which increased search traffic and then that increased either funnel (leads/opportunities) or direct e-commerce transactions/revenue, that’s a great conversation.  You’d stand out as someone who is thorough and doesn’t leave money on the table for the business.  On the flip side, if you just say you got to #1 on Bing without explaining downstream outcomes I’d have a lot of questions, and you may or may not get a chance to answer those questions, which is not a good thing.  
SEO is about connecting with people in all the relevant places they search.
But why?
- etc.
Most companies ad agencies deal with on a regular basis are local. That being said, the real aim for most clients you work with is not to rank #1 on google/Bing/whatever platform you're working on. It's to get your client the most ROI possible (Return on Investment= (Revenue-costs/costs) basically making as much revenue as you can while also reducing costs as much as you can) . In many cases, sure, you could rank #1 or #2 on Bing or Google but that makes you end up paying more in cost per click than you should be paying. Basically you want your ad ranking to be between 3 and 6.  This gains your ad the same amount of visibility while paying less. Ranking high doesn't really mean much unless if your client is a huge business like best buy. 
That being said, most clients are local businesses so if I were you on that account , I'd reduce my cpc. And I would probably leave the rank #1 thing out of my resume because that only tells companies that you don't know how to truly optimize a campaign.
I was working with a local pest control company as a client. My daily budget was $100 a day. However, because the space was so competitive on Google, the keywords that I was bidding on were too expensive. This is what resulted in me switching to Bing because bings target users as a whole are people aged 30 and up, which match the same target audience of the pest control company. Not only that, but the space of Bing is less competitive thereby driving down cost per click. Using that knowledge, I had more of a budget to work with and as a result, I was able to reduce my cost per conversion due to my limited budget before and increase my ROI by 39%.
That stuff is what's going to impress your hiring manager. 
Try out a few and see what you like. You have a lot of relevant experience that I didn’t have when I started so that’s a plus. I started off by emailing every single agency in my area, even if they didn’t have a job posted, then one hired me to work mostly on FB/Instagram ads for their clients. Since then I’ve learned a lot of the rest on the job. 
Revamp hashtags on previous posts every 4 days (especially low volume ones) 
If I were in your shoes, I'd find all the keywords related to your course's NICHE
The key is to SHARE INFORMATION and ask questions to get email-based engagement
The secret is to hit as many platforms with custom responses as possible
Shortcut? Hire a VA to do all the heavy lifting for you - you focus on  your email list automated updates so you CONVERT as much of your list members into UDEMY COURSE buyers. You can hire VAs from a wide range of platforms 
\- Cognoplus (pay based on results - $30  for quota based on 8 hours of work - day to day)
Have you tried facebook ads? they run on facebook and instagram and let you target people based on psychographics. 
I would but it's proprietary plus most comes from our dashboard.
We've got Google and Bing search/shopping, YouTube, fb, ig, display, ctv, programmatic radio, snap chat, yelp, etc.
You should learn how to build these and make it better over time. This is important skill to develop in our industry.
Learn basic statistics and how to make useable inferences from data.
Take time off. Leave on time. Go on holidays. Pace yourself. If something doesn’t need to absolutely be done by the end of the day, leave at 5.30pm and do it tomorrow.
Actual paid employment marketing work for clients has very little to do with what you read about marketing online from experts and gurus and blogs. It's about doing the work, consistently, thoroughly, and professionally. You'll spend a lot more time working with budgets, contracts, and tracking. 
Your going to get a ton of digital resources (moz, Google analytics courses, FB blueprint etc) but don't forget me things theory - no matter how old it might feel! 
There are so many free blogging sites, although you need to be careful if you start sending too much traffic.
If you want more info on affiliate and email marketing, please let me know. There are many more free resources to help you get started.
>I was hoping to get some ideas about how we could use it better.
Adding personalisation should see your email, SMS and phone Comms from CRM campaigns increase in their engagement levels. 
As stated in other responses. Use the segmentation of the data to provide for better audience based targeting and lookalike creation. Depending on the volume you have you could get really creative and targeted for lookalike based targeting.
Note of caution. The more data you have and the more segmentation you subject your CRM to, the higher the margin of error for the audiences.
I would also set up lookalike audiences with lead gen ads that trigger your email flow after a user submits their email. 
* If you haven't had someone visit in a while, you could send a coupon for their next visit.
Don’t think so. Best practices are to make sure a site is indexed before you do any outreach to it. I’d imagine the same goes for the page containing the backlink. 
The only people i know that care about degrees are companies... real entrepreneurs or business owners don't care about that. They only care about results.
MarketingDaily is mu subredit, it might work for you. 
R/Entrepreneur otherwise i could not find anything interesting. Blackhatworld.com and digitalpoint forums
Based on what you have given us. Google Analytics.
This is something I'm looking into building. A SaaS solution where you can create, edit, copy, and publish ads to a variety of channels from one place. 
Not sure if this would be useful for others but I think it would help me when I'm building campaigns out on multiple channels and there's a lot of overlap.
 Companies that hope to effectively spread the word about their offerings, attract customers, engage with them and ultimately retain them, need to adapt to these changes. Those that fail to do so will fall behind. There are great marketing softwares that can help companies remain relevant and master marketing in the digital age: 
Google Drive and Google Photos have been amazing for me.  There are a zillion solutions- look up "Digital Asset Managers." But after comparing price, storage, features Google Drive was best. 
Try to work on your file naming to include a date and some basic description. 
Tbh I'm saying all this when my own media is in an awful state and needs cleaning!
Also don't forget the rule - "two is one and one is none" when it comes to backup! If you have media you truly need safe then it needs to be backed up twice on 2 separate mediums. External drive/CD/NAS are all affordable options for this.
I use Google Drive too but I still like to stick to the habit of backing everything up/organising everything on physical drives too. 
I make a folder for each client then tend to have subfolders of 'Output' (inside of which I have a folder for each blog post or video I've created etc. These folder titles always start with the date first so that they're easy to order chronologically), 'Client Reports', 'Initial Audit/Agreements' and then whatever else is required, client dependant. There's also a media file where I dump in any and all relevant images and media files. I make sure to split these into 'Used' and 'Unused' folders so that if I have a last minute request or some industry news appears that requires a quick post to social media etc, I can quickly see which images I have used and which are still available to me. 
Just to make it easier as well I tend to tag anything already posted with a green tag and anything scheduled to go with an orange tag.  Red tags are used for things I've made but for whatever reason am not happy to send out. The plan is to tag them in red so that I might go back and edit or improve them at a later date but to be honest that rarely ever happens. 
It was a real hassle to set this up at initially and I wish I'd done it from day one but now that it's done it is really useful.  I know I have a physical copy of all my client work on a harddrive at home and in another location just in case. I keep one drive as a master drive which is what I work off of and then each couple of weeks I'll copy everything across to the other drive, which autmatically takes out any duplicates. 
There are definitely much easier ways to do it I know but it was hurting my head each time to get used to diffeent setups and search around for work. I feel like having a consistency between my layouts just puts my mind at ease and makes things easier to find. I think it's whatever works for you that's most important, just make sure that you find a setup that works and keep that style across all clients. 
I don't know company specifics, however I would reccomend going to a company in London.
Namely for the fact that it's the most competitive environment it's dog eat dog and you are going to learn from the best.
In my last agency, we didn't pay much attention to college degrees or certifications (Our SVP had a bachelors in History / no certifications). It was entirely based on experience and how well the candidates articulated themselves (we paid attention and would ask 'can we see this person interacting with clients), and also strategies on the spot by presenting vague and bizarre situations. I guess it varies by agency though.
It may help you get an in-house position, where the marketing managers don't really know digital marketing and don't know any better.  It won't help you get a job at a high-level, experienced agency. An experienced manager will be able to ask you questions to gauge your knowledge. You take take a ton of these certifications and still not know what you're doing. 
Is the graphic design degree from hub stop or is it a actual degree’frommcollege?
Where is the web dev certification from?
A lot of webinar platforms will let you test drive their software for a short period of time. 
I've never used a webinar tool that was light years ahead the competition.  All of them are generally alright but usually have some goofy user interface problems.  I work with a large variety of clients who aren't always tech savvy so having something simple that doesn't require a download is usually vital.  Join.Me or Skype are probably my favorite, GoToMeeting close 3rd.
I just started using webinarjam for live and everwebinar for replays. Webinarjam is the cheapest in the game from what I found, only run a few webinars with it but so far it's great. 
I wouldn't worry so much about becoming obsolete, IMO you are more likely to stay ahead of the curve in terms of trends and progression etc. - if you want to anyway. 
I suspect your lens has been a bit distorted from working at google and expedia who are leading online businesses. There will also be many many companies lagging far behind so in five years time they won't even be where you are now. I recently left a multi billion dollar company who's digital strategy extended no further than a massively overpriced website, monthly facebook updates and a couple of things on linkedin. In 2023 they might be looking for a DMM role!
1. experience, which you have.
freelance is irrelevant if you can generate results. if you say you can lift my business's web rank within the top 10 listings on a SERP have content appear in a featured snippet, I will take notice.
Maybe not yet.  You do get aggregate data regarding customer activities across platforms and browsers, but I think it will take time to make sense of that information.  After seeing your post, I checked out some articles and no one really knows what to do with this tool yet.  
Search should work with social and also with display to round it out.
Another thing about search is do NOT forget Bing. They're 30% of the search market. Age skews a bit higher. Income skews higher and the cost is generally lower.
30% of budget for social media ads
remarketing is cheaper
It depends. Depends on the industry and the sales cycle. 
* [SEO starter pack ($150)](https://academy.moz.com/series/starter-pack)
I agree, basic Google ananytics understanding is huge. Get to know moz tools too.
Also good to know google keyword planner, google trends tool, and google and bing webmaster tools.
I've been wondering the same as well,  Paid media is a great area to learn, facebook blueprint is pretty straight forward info unfortunately its nothing close to the experience of actually running campaigns. I also had some experience with hubspot a few years ago and they have some great certificates 
A webpage tool like WordPress( Yoast has a plugin to help with SEO) 
A CRM software like salesforce. 
I agree that stomaching the cost of ahrefs is not something anyone wants to do, but it is hard helped me get a significant ROI for my clients, and is worth every dollar in my opinion. I am also getting ready to invest in CORA which is $250 a month to do single and double variable testing for the various ranking factors. 
SEMrush. If you're going to do it, do it right the first time. 
The best tool is Google keywords planner.
You can take a free one month trial of SEMrush.
These amazing tools have helped my organic traffic (zangi.com) grow by 25.54% over the last 6 months. 
I've seen this same issue before. It is almost always an issue with the store. Do you have a link to your website?
Do you have brand protections like negative keywords and app category exclusions? It’s easy to end up blowing your whole remarking budget on brietbart articles and candy crush ads that get 100% ignored or even make your customers angry because they see your brand as supporting politics that they don’t agree with. Exclusions are getting harder and harder to manage as google tries to push off more of its low quality traffic to small business due to proctor and gamble types starting to pay attention to performance instead of saying “woohoo we got 14 billion impressions so everything is obviously wonderful”. 
This is what I found too. I binned Google for remarketing. 
In my opinion, remarketing is more about emotional spontaneous buying, and Google Ads just don't facilitate that type of marketing. 
You need to implement a retargetting strategy. Drop me a message, if you need more details on that. It depends from website to website. Send me the website link. I will help you with retargetting.
TL;DR I wouldn't advise it.
As an admin, I do manage 7 Instagram pages mainly about Fashions. I have used various bots for my job including Instabotfather, Instazood, Tagscout etc. The most important things that I have found so far are:
2. While starting a bot for an Instagram account, we should not perform interaction on Instagram manually (once I had two of my accounts blocked temporarily)
In general, I have understood that regardless of the performance of the bot, if the admin of a specific page does not focus on content generating the bot is totally useless. On the other hand, if someone focuses on a page to simultaneously produce content and perform interactions on Instagram, they may need a 36 hours a day than 24 hours. I personally prefer using bots to save time and boost my accounts. Instabotfather is now the bot I choose to use because of the customer service but the other two are good as well.
I enjoyed Digital Summit. Martech Conf is a good one too. Biggest thing is to read if they allow self promotional pitches or only educational content. Don’t want to accidentally attend a living commercial. 
SMX is a top-tier search conference and our favorite. Digital Summit is a higher level marketing conference. Good keynotes but the session speakers can be really hit-or-miss. I wouldn't go again, but I'm sure that my job is different than yours.
For example, if you want to earn 3000$ per month, working 22 days per month with 6 hours per day. You have 132 hours of work per month. So, you need to make 22,7$ per hour to reach 3000$ per month.
Depends on the client, budget, and scope of work. Typically working of a percent with a minimum works best. 
Using page level data to define the context of the page and then using that page level definition to serve contextually relevant ads. So, an article in USA Today about the LA Dodgers is about baseball, LA, the Dodgers and specific players. An advertiser who wants to sell Dodgers gear would appear on that page.
Google Ad Sense is the first major contextual advertising network. These are the services that advertising agency might provide:
1. creation—what the advertisement looks like
take a look at Grapeshot, they do exactly this
Failing that good old excel and a few pain staking hours. Good luck.
If you're talking about tracking the Keyword Rankings of the website, then you can use the [**Rankwatch Tool**](https://www.rankwatch.com/) to track your keywords. It's quite a comprehensive tool that you can use to track the particular keywords you want to. You can use it to track the keyword rankings Before the optimization and then After it, so that you can compare what's your website's standings.Cheers!
I believe visually compelling products has more chances in going viral on social media. But still with enough creativity, traditional products can take advantage too.
Fashionable watch brands like MVMT have benefited massively.. really strong creative and clever targeting have made them hundreds of millions.. the watches themselves are poor quality
eCommerce is the industry that  most benefits from social media marketing.
Social media marketing is a broad term for the marketing activities a company is using on the social media medium.  
It is hard to answer which industry, but it is easier to answer what kind of company: Big/SME/Start-ups. Obviously SME and Start-ups got the most benefit from social media marketing where they can compete easier with big brands. In the past SMEs or Start-ups could not compete these giants where marketing channels were mostly offline.
I am a digital marketing director and got my degree online from the University of Phoenix. What got me into the industry was an internship. I would recommend that over going back to school.
I'm the director of marketing for a national marketing agency. I market the marketing agency, and I don't have a degree. I don't think a masters in marketing is really all that neccesary to have a great marketing career since anything digital changes too quickly. What counts is experience. 
Build up your portfolio, especially if you're looking to work in visual media. Find some friends who need your services and charge them next to nothing (but do charge them. You're a pro.) Do the free certifications like HubSpot (for a clear understanding of the role visual media and content in general play in the marketing funnel), Google and Facebook for learning to run ads and navigate those platforms on behalf of a client. But don't waste the time you could be using to gain experience on a year plus spent in school. 
Marketing is an art. It should come naturally. If yes, then you don't need any degree. If you think a degree is hopding you back, then work on your confidence and self-esteem. 
That said, a degree just ensures that you have basic of marketing covered. But just like a good painter is not someone who knows all different types of painting out there but rather someone who knows the art of painting. 
Lol marketing doesn’t need a freeking masters I don’t care what degree you have if you can’t sell the products then you are as useless as they come.A agency wants experience and someone that cranks out the sales.I have no degree and I plan to work for a agency I’m not sure how hard it is to acquire one of these positions and I honestly don’t care.Because if it’s anything I learned in business is and marketing for 6 years is that a company wants a results and will do anything for them.I would personally not get a masters in marketing that is nonsense 
Have one table showing total campaign data.  Have about a month of data broken out by weeks.  So he can see how the campaign has been doing week over week.  So it would be 4 rows for the table.
1: Know your customer base. Where do you want to start? Who are you targeting? What demographics is on your checklist? Best advice: Always start small. Forget about scaling and big releases (You don't have the resources to go big just yet).
3: What do you meant by "attacking"? Perhaps further clarification on how you actually wants to "attack" "launch" your strategy onto the market with low-risk decision-making process? 
I’ve really enjoyed working with the spy tool Adplexity, let me know if you’re interested and I’ll hook you up with a referral/discount link.
You could maybe also try Pinterest? (I'm from the Netherlands and I read that it is quite popular among the 50 plus age group)

The easiest way is to have one central Facebook Business Manager with separate ad accounts for each client, using their payment method (credit card is easiest). They pay for their ad spend directly, and get invoiced.
I prefer to have my clients pay Google and Facebook directly, rather than I pay it and they pay me back. Reduces my risk if they decide to not pay and saves me money on merchant processing fees. I'm happy to let the client enter their billing information themselves or they can provide it to me and I enter it for them.
I tell my client they can do it either via a screen share, or if they're comfortable, over the phone.
It was free money. If you're not doing it this way as an individual then you're missing out. 
Two have them fill out a credit authorization form for you to use 
Maybe a Youtube vlog-like series where its more behind the scenes and you recording, trying to make it as an artist.
Just trying to blow things up by getting likes is fluffy and useless. Spend money to make money.
 I feel the same way to be honest. I have seen it with a few clients and now with my client-side gig. 
I think the value is branding. I feel like the best strategy is to pick one channel and just out all your effort there. 
Unfortunately I think it’s easy for unsophisticated managers / owners to put too much weight on social followers as a metric, when for a lot of companies social users may not convert in any meaningful quantity.
I think it’s best to pick one or two key networks where your customers are likely to be (research needed) and spend time there, but not too much time. A few hours a week is probably overkill for most small businesses.
Definitely depends on the company and industry. Social is great for branding and engagement but depending on the business that isn’t worth time and money. I do think it’s important to have a presence though, such as having a profile and not being active, just so people can check in (if necessary) or review if you don’t have a budget for social. 
Like all marketing campaigns it depends entirely on the vertical / clients / campaign objectives. If it wasn't worth it, advertisers wouldn't use it.
I agree, but I've seen social media bring direct sales in some cases! I help manage the FB page of a pizza place nearby, and they have a special offer that runs all year long. If you can finish their biggest pizza in under 20 minutes, you get it for free. We got a few customers that went and did it based on a post I made about it! It was cool to see that direct return but it doesn't happen often.
When I'm working with visually attractive content, Instagram brings the greatest traffic. When I'm doing all the same with financial companies - IG doesn't work, but FB and LinkedIn do their best.
Simply put, everything depends on your mission and type of business. It's up to no one else but you to figure out what works best for your particular company / business.
 Well that’s not always the case. I’ve seen businesses using solely social media to acquire customers and visitors.
Ahrefs tool is best for checking backlinks, competitor keyword analysis, keywords position and broken links..etc
**"SEMRUSH"** is the best tool to analysis all your website report (traffic, traffic source, competitor traffic, keyword position)
I prefer ahrefs as it just opens up the whole site skeleton of the website and not just backlinks. top pages, keywords, broken links, new and old backlinks, social shares and much more.
Comscore is the gold standard but it’s not cheap so it’s pretty much for larger orgs.  Similarweb is probably the best low-cost alternative.  
Actually I prefer to use SEO Quake. It is one of the effective weapons associated with SEMRush. You can use its add-on (Chrome and Mozilla) with or without SEMRush. Count it as a tool to audit the complete web page or website in terms of SEO ranking. And, as a mobile version, it is only able to give a full report, named as- Page SEO Audit Report. 
3. **InfiniGraph** – watch social media trends: InfiniGraph tracks trends in social media circles. It combines consumer-to-brand interactions in real time and uses targeting to find out what brands and content are popular right now.
6. **Followerwonk** – analyze Twitter followers: Follower wonk analyzes any Twitter profile for free to boost your Twitter marketing strategies. It provides a wide range of details, like recent tweets, bios, locations, and the authority of followers, to get the overall picture of your competitors’ Twitter presence.
Depends on the client really. Microsoft planner, data studio, sheets and sometimes a plain old notebook. 
We use a variety of tools, we manage our projects on a tool called monday.com which really allows us to know what stage a certain project is in should it require multiple team members to complete it. In terms of tracking hours, we don't actually do that but we do set tight deadlines in our project workflow so that everyone can plan their other tasks...this is not a comprehensive answer but I hope that it has shed some sort of light!
Harvest for billable hours...
Also, don't use Google autosuggested keywords as that will eat up your budget and make it harder to compete on keywords that will give you a strong ROI. Google wants you to spend more on their platform, not less, and the suggested keywords will dominate your budget.
Reactionary preemptive campaign optimization will never allow you to build campaigns that consistently drive conversions.
Drop me a DM and I will take a look and suggest few changes where required. No charges. All I ask is a healthy review in return. Thanks!
* Site speed, massively important these days, use Google's SiteSpeed tool to make sure both desktop and mobile aren't throwing up any flags
* What are you tracking as a conversion? Is your tracking setup correctly? Do a trial conversion and see if it gets picked up \(keep in mind, you will never successfully track 100&#37; of visitors, typically you miss \+/\- 10&#37;, higher if you have a young / tech demographic \(with browser tracking disabled\)
* Ad copy \- short, snippy and to the point. Don't use buzzwords and you need to split test a wide range of ads when starting off so you know what works, and what doesn't.
If you had no conversion ! First make sure that there are no other problems (like broken button, maybe compatibility to a certain OS,  or maybe too much info in a form) first be sure that there are no design flaws or broken code
Maybe you are a shitty writer (you probably aren't) but try different approaches, and look critical to your work. Free articles, ebooks, free shipping if you order now, coupons.. endless opportunities. Run different campaigns at different times and see how they perform. 
It's so easy to make it less efficient and more costly.
If you can plug in the numbers for how much margin you make on each dress, and how sales increase from the $5000 marketing spend, you can come up with a good ROI. Use previous campaigns as a benchmark (if they let you have that data). u/UsamaDM gave good advice. Focus on the two channels that will work the best. I haven't worked in fashion so I can't give specific industry advice, so I'll just say that remarketing usually works well for campaigns, and paid social seems to work well, too. Good luck.
I would suggest you to go for maximum 2 channels in the start or you would exhaust yourself and your budget without getting any results.
In your situation you're not going to be able to get people to care otherwise, at least not without a newsworthy event happening at your school.
Are the  guidelines on topics of students interest? Because I think that this is very important. Can you use the social media that your classmates use, like Instagram, Facebook , twitter for spread the content. Use memes and images to attract them. **Do you need go where they are!** 
You may also want to check out Google Trends (can specifically filter Youtube). It won't show you exact search numbers each month, but it will show you people's interest in that subject over time. So if you see that interest has been declining for past few years, maybe it's not worth to create a video on that subject https://trends.google.com
I never used Ubersuggest but it looks legit and since it's on Neil Patel's website it has to be somewhat decent.
Autocomplete and Google Trends help a lot too.
[Vid.IQ](https://Vid.IQ) is pretty good tool for Youtube keyword research, they have a free trial so you can just export all the keywords from there and cancel the account. 
I would spend my time getting the Google Analytics and Google AdWords certifications instead. They’re free and are more widely known and applicable to a variety of marketing jobs. 
Facebook blueprint and Hubspot certs have been enough for me in my job hunts, but it does depend on your career goals. 
I'm happy working in-house and working my way up. I don't think I'd have a lot of success breaking into a huge household agency with my current certifications, but I'm okay with that.
It’s as worthless as my toilet paper.  If you like throwing money away like Jordan Belfort did during the yacht scene of Wolf of Wallstreet, then by all means it’s worth it. You’re better off applying what you’ve learned from Google, Hubspot, Facebook Blueprint courses and some notable marketing books and online guides on your own projects, an internship, a local business or a non profit online marketing endeavors. If you do that and really apply your self in building a portfolio you’ll get hired relatively quickly. I just saved you thousands of dollars. 
I have also looked at 
Hey, our business uses HubSpot and we love it. We use it to schedule social media posts, create landing pages and blog posts, update our contact list and much more. It certainty makes our life easier because we can post and track everything within one platform. Hope this helps! 
I am using Marketo from last one year, it is the most Advanced Marketing Automation tool I have ever used.
I don't knwo why you have added Buffer here.
Leadssquared, Getresponce, Aweber etc.
There are a few out there, I've used Pardot, Marketo, and HubSpot. Buffer is not marketing automation (I've also used this tool for social). Marketo is very powerful, but quite hard to learn. I prefer HubSpot or Pardot to be honest.
My wife is training on Marketo right now and hates it. She uses it for email marketing and says it’s not set up like any other ESP she has used. 
Blu180 puts together a nice dashboard  with all that plus social media content citation and scheduling. 
Edit: trialed Hubspot. Liked it. But found it  too general and expensive for the value it provides.
Hey, I use Hubspot for all of my marketing activities. Hubspot is an amazing software which helps me manage my blogs, create landing pages with amazing templates available, lets my email automation work smoothly, plus it also shows how my website has performed with some amazing analytics. I also like how they have workflows and lead forms set up. A great tool one must use for their marketing purposes. I instead of buffer, use SocialPilot. Another amazing social media scheduling and analytics tool which saves me atleast 5 hours every week off social media. It has a very nice branding feature which lets me brand my own name on Facebook which has helped my increase my visibility on Facebook. 
I love my Buffer cause it saves my time - I can plane posts for a week just in half an hour. For SMM-managers Buffer is a real god blessing tool)
Schools that teach digital marketing will always be behind on current trends since the internet is changing so fast. I’d recommend against it. 
I've been a buy side AdOps specialist for almost 6 years now, and my degree is in Sport Administration.  I think that any business degree, probably also focusing in marketing would be sufficient.  Obviously different schools have different degree types and stuff, but it's up to you in the end!
You’re better off getting a degree in marketing so you have a good foundation. You can learn so much more in a digital internship than a degree since as someone else mentioned schools have a hard time keeping up with the latest trends and tech changes. 
Hell no, if you like to throw money away then by all means do so. A marketing degree is better but you don’t need that either. If you really want to get a paying job, just start building knowledge of how these digital platforms work with the training provided from Google, Facebook, Hubspot and then start building a portfolio of actual digital work you have done.  Main thing is getting good knowledge and theory and then executing in this field. I would recommend job shadowing to see if this something you’ll like where you’ll further see the skills involved. 
No! Go after marketing in general to get the bigger picture. You can learn platforms & tools in practice when you start working. It’s changing too fast and everything you’ll learn will become obsolete by the time you get on the job market.
I graduated in com last spring and now I manage a $1.1 m digital ad budget. If I could go back and do it all over again, I would switch to strat com. Numbers were never my strong point but now that I do what I do, you have to be on top of your game with numbers. Also I would have tried to take some classes that taught some basic JavaScript. 
- start making connections now. Create a LinkedIn profile and get acquainted with people in the industry in your area. You can do this by attending local meetups, or simply checking with some people that work at agencies/startups/businesses and hitting them up for career advice. It's terrifying at first, but for every 5-10 people you approach for tips (be succinct) you'll likely get 1-2 nuggets of wisdom that will help you further.
I do this, I help a SaaS (Software As A Service) company understand user behavior, I measure CLTV (Customer Lifetime Value) from different sources, ads efficiency and more.
If you serve something else, let me know and I'll try to help you get the right resources for you.
I’m studying marketing at Uni and did a subject last semester on metrics. We got given a set of data and had to answer a series of questions on different attributes and see what was and wasn’t related (regression etc). I’d be happy to send you the materials if you like? 
Very informative post. All 11 SEO Techniques are very useful for getting ranking and increase the business.
Every conference attended this year spent at least 3 hours on the topic with no real insight. 
Digital media is media...or some BS like that.
The web is full of content now, marketers need to figure out how to stand out from the noise for their target.
Surprised that didn't catch on more. Referring to marketing that doesn't look like marketing esp. on social platforms.
Don't know why but *crunch the data* gets on my nerves.
"No Content without Video"
You know how in a social situation two people can say absolutely the same thing in virtually the same situation, but when one of them says it, it will be funny, and when the other does it, it will not be as funny. 
You should definitely bring it up. It's possible they're taking advantage of you being nice, it's just as possible they don't even realize you aren't making more.
1) how much is payed someone in your role on the market?
2) which is the range you think it's worth for you?
2. Do phone interviews during your lunch break.
3. Use a doctors appointment, family emergency, or vacation day to interview on site with whoever wants to talk.
4. Get an offer on paper for more than you currently work.
Problem is, if this is a high-profile company and they are paying peanuts they probably do not value digital marketing as much as they should and they most likely won't pay more.
io like the ones were ppl fill out of the form
2. Write content for your target personas, not for the general public
3. Write a headline so strong the user can’t do anything but convert
5. Strategically position your landing page elements to drive conversions
Learn from all the free courses such as Google's Digital Garage etc and impliment what you learn towards a personal objective! Learn through trial and error and proceed accordingly! 
Let me know if you find anything
There's a free trial course for a month on Shaw academy! Google it! It's live webinars 
A great resource for understanding Search Engine Optimization is available on Moz. The link is https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo. This gives an overview in a free textbook format of how to get websites ranking on search engines which is an integral part to digital marketing. A great addition to this would be getting certified as a google Adwords partner. Google has a free extensive study guide laid out for taking the test as well located on their Adwords platform. These two tools together will give you a substantial head start. Also, being certified on google Adwords will go a long way on a resume. I also have a page dedicated to various digital marketing degree programs located in Michigan that are definitely worth the money. https://intelligentdesigndigitalmarketing.com/michigan-digital-marketing-degree-programs
There are some great courses. I agree with @kbechard15 about the Moz beginning guide to SEO It's really comprehensive and just got an update. 
In addition to learning about digital marketing, do some real-world learning Try building and optimizing a website. Get really comfortable with Google Analytics. Follow blogs and listen to podcasts as this industry changes fast. 
You can attend free webinars, Q & A sessions to get guidance from industry experts.
You can find free courses on Udemy, Alison, Coursera. I also recommend reading news and articles, since digital is changing very rapidly. I would suggest sources such as: Adweek, TechCrunch, Adage, Digiday, Marketingland, MediaPost, eMarketer
I wouldn't get bogged down with long courses unless it was for impressing an employer. If you are running your own agency there are quicker and more profit focused methods.
collecting big data.. which are helpful in driving a business plan to increase ROI
Basically you do the behind the scenes work so the customer doesn't have to, and can just tell you what they need via email or call.
An agency will either hire someone with AM, advertiser, publisher, or network/platform experience, or a recent grad or something that seems generally bright and trainable.
Basically the middle man between a client and the agency. Usually puts work into production and makes sure that accounts are still profitable while also trying to upsell additional marketing jobs when and if necessary. 
Oh and they manage accounts. 
Recently, I listened to a podcast episode interviewing some people who researched stuff like this. They talked about how algorithms and control over digital interfaces allow for companies to present fixed and dynamic prices depending on the market and product. For instance, for a necessity like gasoline, they predicted that algorithms would eventually stabilize the price of gas across different companies because any price change would cause an instant adjustment in the other companies' prices. For dynamic prices, an example would be a company like Amazon being able to present different prices to different customers–perhaps a higher price tag for a user more likely to have money or to be highly likely to purchase that product no matter what or a lower price tag to compel someone to purchase it who was on the fence. As this kind of big data progresses, shopping as we know it could very well end because we wouldn't be able to hunt for deals–the deals would hunt us. 
That's my view on it.
Face filter for geo filter? 
I've been using Geo-filters for over a year now, my CPM is around $0.75 
Face filters and video ads may cost as high as $35 CPM. 
If you are talking about geo filters, they are not too expensive and fairly manageable for even small businesses. Check out pricing here:
Yep, not geofilters but actual lenses. AR, face-morphing etc.
There are many ways to increase conversion rate as:
2. Include the privacy statement on opt-in forms.
4. Use high quality images & CTA button for different links.
2. Per hour basis.
This one is useful for start-ups that target businesses and want to solidify their SEO and SEM strategy. I would charge:
2 hour each week optimising the ads. 
5. Digital Marketing is not just about SEM; it's so much more than that. You will need (Social media, SEO, SEM, Marketing automation, community, content, analytics) to gain mastery in this world. 
6. The next certificate you need is Google analytics. 
So if I charge someone day, $500 to manage their Facebook ads, does the ad spend come out of the $500 or do they pay me the balance of whatever is spent?
Hostgator has always been solid for our dev environments. Though we moved to AWS recently for production and the speed is unreal. 
Hostgator shared hosting for 0.5 to 1M page views a month.
Thank you for not just listing but also giving details. Made it 10x worth it.
I have a rather poor experience with LinkedIn groups. I haven't started one myself but am a member of a few social media marketing groups and the sad reality was that most of the people in those groups was there simply to promote their own content. Basically, there were tens or hundreds of articles posted daily with almost no engagement, or some spam account commenting something like "Excellent coverage" next to each and every post.
Years ago I joined lots of groups related to e-commerce, online marketing, social media, and advertising. Nothing of value from them, ever. Nothing but spam. Come to think of it, that pretty much sums up my whole LinkedIn experience. 
As for the spams it needs to be moderators on each group so people don’t get reluctant and a spammy group is in my opinion a group that is not well managed.
I really don't know if such thing exists. But I think it's easier to answer with some guidance.
Stay focused and don't try and do everything. 
It's a gastopub and not a Fortune 500 company so you may just need one or two channels (Instagram and Yelp?) where you focus in on refining the pubs image.  
Read Gary Vaynerchuk too.
Who are your customers, and what platforms are they on?
I started making way more money after becoming a consultant and charging on % ad spend for this reason.
I work in this field and I do not get a percentage of increased revenue.  I optimize the full funnel though and there are so many people and processes involved it would be unfair to say that I should get a cut of increases and not everyone else involved.  I believe I am well compensated through the standard bonus structure plus I like the stability.  What you’re describing is a sales style compensation model which can have big booms and busts that are often frankly out of your control.
Normally performances based bonuses have a number of goals (like +x% ROAS, +y% conversation rate in segment z, etc.) tied to a fixed amount of money.
My agency charges % of ad spend and then I get a salary that never budges, even when spend scales hundreds of thousands of dollars. 🙃 never heard of getting %of revenue increases in performance marketing though.
You will find freelance work without experience if you work hard for it. And it might suck at the beginning: things will be harder than you thought and you won't know how to communicate with your first client or what to say but it's normal, just don't give up.
There are a bunch of other platforms out there you can try I am personally working on PeoplePerHour and I think it's better suited for you as a beginner because they have a system that encourages new freelancers to apply and find jobs and they offer free proposals you could use to apply to projects as opposed to Upwork who charge even for that.
You also need to understand that freelance success isn't much about skills but really about good communication and going the extra mile to help the clients solve their problems.
But don't sell yourself too short. Not all clients are equal. Some cheap clients you want to avoid because they're toxic and will suck life out of you avoid them at all cost. Know what the type of clients you want to work with. Attract them and build longlasting relationships with them
Why would someone pay you?
I got my first copywriting job on Upwork without any experience. It was a $30 job for a blog post. It took me about 1-2 weeks to get my first client.
1) Your profile
At this point, you could have the best profile in the world but it doesn't mean anything until you get reviews. Just say what problem faces your client and say you how you will help them solve it. Keep it simple.  
Your proposal is what gets your foot in the door. Read each job post carefully. When you send the proposal, talk about what problem they're having and suggest how they can solve it. Basically provide value and not sell yourself. Your aim is to get a response.
Honestly, Upwork is great for experience but I'd start looking elsewhere if you really want to dive into freelance work.
If they don’t ask you to sign any conflict of interest document, you’re good. If they do, it’ll be up to you to decide if they extra money is worth not being able to work with other potential clients in the same industry. 
I’ve done the exact thing you’re doing and I’ve only had 1 situation like this, and it was for a Law Firm. So I understood the conflict of interest. Although it was only for a specific type of law, so it wasn’t a big deal for me.
Do what you want. There's no such thing as conflict of interest in digital marketing.
You’re not referring to a “media buyer” are you?
If you want local traffic, start with Googles local business and Yelp, both are free.   Most people use their mobile phones when they're out and about looking for liquor, your store will show up on google if they're in the area.
Social Media will not help you.  liquor stores are everywhere and all the same.  People are not loyal to one store, they'll go where its closes. So 99% of your business will be from locals.
If you want to pay, you could make a facebook page and target your local audience.
Social media ads will work and so will email marketing. 
Utilize social media to post organically and gain a following. 
Digital marketing works and if you’re not doing it, you’re losing. 
I don't know where you live, but if they allow alcohol delivery, I would DEFINITELY do it. I'm in South Florida and you can get alcohol delivered on on one of the "food" delivery apps. Can't remember which one, BUT....keeping your product at a good price and not jack up your delivery fee would increase your awareness and loyalty.
The free listings like GMB and yelp take ages to build momentum and possibly never, if you do not optimize it with contents all the time. The problem with Google 3 snack pack is that your actual website needs to be seriously SEO optimized to show up in the top for major keywords.
PM me if you want to discuss more about it.
* CPC - high traffic
This is how they scam you:
* CPM - low quality cheap impressions
* CPC - cheap bot traffic
* CPA - don't allow retargeting pixels from agencies, or check if traffic sent by agencies are actually returning visitors (this means that they're retargeting your traffic, and it's more common that you might think). Also check if agencies are using "post-view" conversion tracking to charge you and don't do this (it's BS). Due to cookie blocking, using multiple devices and other attribution problems, CPAs are hardest to pull successfully, and if they work surprisingly well, then the odds are you're being gamed...
It depends on the goal of the campaign. If you just want branding/awareness, CPM is fine. If the goal is lead generation,  CPM makes no sense to focus on.
On the platforms that matter, Display = CPM. That's basically it.
CPM can get you more scale
Generally this is less the agency’s choice than the publishers. For example display/banner platforms are usually built around CPM’s. Search platforms are generally CPC. Social runs the gamut. Affiliate does CPA. Though note most platforms have flexibility in pricing models these days. 
CPM is the way the inventory is purchased from the publisher so whether you are being charged a marked up CPM or a CPC it's all the same.
Since clicks are largely irrelevant to a display campaign even for ROAS/Retargeting you'll still want to pay for impressions. Clicks on the ads versus actual traffic registered by analytics is always going to be much lower. 
For programmatic display we charge a Max $6 CPM for example on $3000+ budgets but we often deliver much lower at say $1.5 to 4 CPM combined prospecting and retargeting. 
Low CPM like low CPC means you won't be able to bid on your most valuable users which is less relevant on prospecting (minus garbage inventory) but very important on retargeting.
Do you want to work agency side, or in house? Agency would be an obvious choice given you have direct client experience, but in house pays more and be less hectic in terms of work hours.
In-house agency corporate marketer here. I moved into this role after freelancing for a few months and am really glad I did. I still am able to flex my schedule as needed but also have a ton of stability (plus great benefits). One thing I was really focused on was a 401k plan, so I'm sticking corporate for now.
It's definitely possible. I went from freelance to in-house to agency and now back to freelance. There are pros and cons to all of them but I'm glad to be back freelance as I don't like to have too much income coming from one source. There is strength in numbers! :)
I’m about a month into my digital marketing and web design agency. What is the best way to to get clients. What methods have worked for you guys in the past and what is the best way to approach it?
Google Tag Manger is the "easiest" solution but you need to be mindful that you might get false positives if you don't get the trigger right. 
I was told by one of my professors at uni that you don't want to buy a book on social media marketing because it changes so fast. There are plenty of resources on YouTube and academies that can teach you the basics then you just run with it and see what works for you and what doesn't.
I recommend searching display ads for the particular social media site that you want to learn. Or even just "basic social media marketing help" into YouTube. 
Find a mentor..i.e. someone making a good living doimg what you want to do.
I have used SurveySwap. In fact you fill in other surveys for credits, and you pay credits to the people who filled your survey. You can also pay for credits if you’re lazy tho. You can even target certain demographics (age, country etc). I had around 300 respondents in 2 weeks. Hope this helps! :)
I was in this position before. It will help to start slow and show the decision-maker the value of your approach. 
Sat down and recommended the owner do 10 things in the long run but 2 things immediately. He reviewed my list and we chose 2 actions to take for now. 
It allowed the owner to see what I was doing. I walked him through the results like search ranking and Facebook ad conversion. Once he knew I wasn't wasting money, he'd greenlight the next marketing task.
It’s not too late. I am in a hurry now, but will post later. 
Not too late at all. It’s hard to give specific advice for which area to focus in right now but getting a general marketing exec position should be OK and will give you exposure to what it’s like to work in this industry and whether you want to pursue it further.
To get you started, you should look at perhaps getting a Google Analytics certification or Hubspot inbound marketing. Also check out the Moz Academy if you can. These are all free and will help you brush up on your general skills whilst also showing employers that you’re serious about the switch. Definitely do not buy a course though! You really don’t need to.
If you’re struggling to find work initially then you could speak to the company where you currently work to see if they have any open positions in the marketing department. I initially started out by asking to help our marketing team with just a few hours a week. Eventually I was able to increase this over time and after that I had enough experience to go into interviews with something to talk about. 
I have a master's degree in finance. I went from working at banks to working at a tech company to now breaking into digital marketing.
Run the other way, fast. Go back to the bank. You have it way better than you think.
Not too late at all, especially if you’re ok with more entry level positions, but are you ready for the likely salary drop?
I haven't studied marketing at all yet I am in the industry. Here's my story. 
I've got a degree in journalism, an industry that's an asshole to get into especially if you, such as myself, are an immigrant. By a mere chance I landed myself a job in what I thought was PR, but my responsibilities were mostly running social media - what can I say, the company was Chinese. As a matter of fact, it closed down within month and a half.
So, I've started a job hunt again. Whenever I was attempting to get a job in PR, my little bubble was starting to burst as some employers explained to me my previous experience belonged in digital marketing department rather than PR. So, this way I've began applying for Digital Marketing instead while still being a journalism grad with 1.5 months experience in 'PR'. 
Needless to say no one was willing to give me a job. On the other hand, I've been offered a paid 3 months internship. While I worked for a bare minimum, the amount of experience gained is insufferable and lead me to further progression later on. 
So, I didn't even plan on reprofiling into Digital Marketing nor had interest or sufficient knowledge to it other than social media maintenance experience and basic knowledge of SEO and wordpress. 
It is a very easy industry to get into, even if you haven't studied it. As long as you're a fast learner, you will most definitely succeed. 
Buy a course from someone who’s killing it. Join Facebook groups
I work for a media company that publishes numerous websites. We have agency relationships but they’re buyers of our inventory not true partners like you’re saying. We have various teams tasked with managing our technology stack and yield management is a huge part of what they do. They analyze all the sell side ad tech and make decisions but there aren’t really intermediaries it’s a direct relationship between us and the ad tech vendors. 
Many ad ops outsource shops do similar things, but each has its own flavor and implementation. Publishers sometimes will try out different solutions, but often they will only move if something is not going as well as they’d hoped. 
Google Ads: get certified, it’s free and you’ll learn just about everything you need to know. Also make sure you install Google’s tracking features.
I use google sheets to track a lot of my activity. Example you can have a sheet with the ad and then copy it over to a new cell every time you make a change to the ad copy label it as a new version (3.1 3.2 etc) - this is also useful because you can run a/b tests this way so you know which ad has been performing best
1. The good ole' Google Sheets: Project Management couldn't get simpler than this
While you can always use the channel specific platform to analyze data, it is best to have them all in once place using a project management tool. Alternatively, you can look at BI tools such as Tableau to have all data in one place.
We use Airtable for bigger campaign execution management. For minor changes, I still have an old school notebook! 
Things like adding keywords to already established ad groups, small copy changes are jotted in my notebook as I go. I know, old school, but it works for me. 
"Oh, so you have x problem? When I worked for xyz, I did this to fix x problem for them." Showing interest in their company and their issues is a strong signal that you've done your research, are engaged in the field, and are worth investing time and effort into pursuing. 
I was also very forward about where my experience lacked, and how I'd like to grow to fill those gaps while in that role. I think managers appreciated the transparency and realistically, a lot of the times they'll backtrack and say "oh there actually is very little of xyz responsibility, we just threw that on there to draw more people in". 
I also tend to go into a phone interview with 3 questions (not including pay/benefits queries), again for the purpose of showing that I've done my research and am invested in their business. 
I struggled with phone interviews when I was first starting off in my career. I would tend to talk way too much since I didn't have the visual cue of knowing whether the interviewer was engaged. Scripting out answers to the standard questions (tell me about yourself? what are your strengths/weaknesses?, etc.), recording myself, and listening to those recordings to improve my pace and confidence.
 \* Increased ROI by 25% through optimizing a multi-million dollar digital advertising spend. 
SMM would be good to start with, because they also have paid advertising on these platforms that are in high demand. If you learn Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter advertising, you'll be in a good spot beside generally knowing social media strategy. 
SEO Will Take more time to give Result and SMM will give you Result Instant but you have to implement properly Otherwise You will not Get You ROI also So i suggest you first learn everything and go a head and Start With SMM and Make Huge Revenue
There is a lot of difference between SEO and SMM. SEO stands for search engine optimization it helps you to get organic traffic from major search engines. Apart from that SMM stands for social media marketing which is use to get paid traffic from various social media channels. 
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:
First of all you need to do a through study of what this business is about and what is the market capability of the business digitally.Then you need to explore that market and see at which point you can take advantage.  
Do you think your company would let you work remotely? I had a friend in advertising in a similar situation. She asked her job if she could move to a different state and work remotely, and they agreed. Doesn’t hurt to ask. 
Probably a waste of money. Talk yourself into an entry level role at an agency and work your way up from there.
I honestly never attended or joined one. I did not go to college for marketing, but now am the head of marketing for a software company. I think if I wanted to get into marketing now, I would do the following (which some you have done):
Everything I learned was on my own and through working at a marketing agency to learn more. But if I was starting now, I'd probably do what I mentioned above.
Save your money and do the free certifications and courses offered by Google and HubSpot. Moz has free courses and so does Hootsuite. If you really want to pay for a course, search Udemy or Udacity for cheap courses (they usually have regular sales where the classes are around $10).
But everything you need to know to get started in digital marketing you can teach yourself. This is exactly the tactics I used to land my first digital marketing job.
The advice I always hear is to specialise on one area in particular. You seem to have a good grasp of a wide range of skills but in order to start moving up it might be worth focusing on one key skill that you enjoy/are good at. 
I've been in the digital marketing field for the last 8 years and I honestly think that given your skill set it shouldn't take more than a year to build small company, leverage your marketing skills and pull 100k a year working for yourself. I am in the process of doing it and I am already making more on my own terms when I decided to use my skills to make my own money. Just remember that mastery of digital marketing principals and advanced practices inevitably lead to entrepreneurship.  
I usually recommend Basecamp for smaller businesses. 99$ flat monthly for unlimited users, unlimited projects.
Trello + Basecamp is seriously powerful. We use Wrike at my marketing agency. It’s really well suited for both project and product management but I have no idea what it costs.  
Base camp is solid but is more for chatting than documenting work and process
There are so many that do the same thing.  At the end of the day how granular do you want the information?
I would love to hear a wide variety of options here. As a web dev agency we've tried a tonne of different platforms. The issue is we need something for CRM, PM, task management, wikis plus more.
The issue I've found is that most systems just do one thing. We want something that spans our whole workflow. It's got to the point where I think we're just going to have to built it ourselves.
One thing we've learnt along the way though - no platform will make up for poor processes and organisation within the team!
Monday - not bad for simple tasks, expensive 
Asana is the hub of our comparably size digital marketing agency. I encourage you give Asana a serious look. Three reasons make this our solution of choice.
We are looking forward to connecting CRM but haven't reached the point where we need one yet. 
It really comes down to what you do. 
If you ask me, my favorite project management app is ProProfs Project. It has all the features a growing agency needs to manage both their projects and teams. I, for one, also needed a tool to manage everything on-the-go, and ProProfs Project definitely helped a lot! A few features it offers include:
I have been using the app for about 1.2 years and it is one of the best apps out there that offer affordable pricing plans too!
This makes sense to me. Focus not only on brand but messaging and imagery too. The subject line should remind them of the ads they've seen, while still intriguing them to find out more, and the imagery can then reinforce that previous ad. 
In theory it makes sense. Next step is to test the theory and A/B it!
\- Easy way to subscribe, just two clicks, no typing - so more no. of subscribers
\- Broadcast messages directly to their FB Messenger - 80-90% open rates
What social media platforms are you familiar with? Have you ever run ads?
What area is this role in? The range seems a tad under market , how many years experience do you have? 
I believe that Rank Math has schema for local seo but i not sure about anything else though.
Schema Markup help search engines to understand all of the context behind your content. You can use schema markup to get all kinds of rich snippets in Google, including:
It’s been useful to me because I’m British and living in France. It’s hard to get into internships here if you’re not affiliated with a uni. And I’m already graduated. Also my French isn’t entirely fluent. So for me, getting experience with an English-speaking company whilst working in France is just so useful (and I can learn & improve my French on the side). 
I use it, it’s pretty basic but I’ve gotten two internships through them. Some of the internships lead to employment, others just give you experience. It’s cool if you have free time. It’s free so  can’t complain 🤷🏻‍♂️ 
We paid like $100 to get somebody for a month I believe 
You don’t need a degree. 
In regards to your Twitter and Instagram, if this is a personal account - about you - in my opinion, this following is not likely to seem impressive to an employer.
You are on the right path, apply for some jobs and see how you get on. You might not go straight to manager level but you could definitely get a job in the space. Do some free courses to improve your knowledge too. Facebook Blueprint for example
I run a digital marketing agency, although we don’t deal directly with organic posting (focus mostly on lead generation) I can tell you that the companies I work with would hire you purely based on the fact you’re interested. If you are one chapter ahead of the person you’re hired by, continue to learn and show charisma you shouldn’t have an issue. 
Startups wont particularly care about education if you have solid evidence you can do the role.
You don't need a degree at all. As a matter of fact you should save the tons of money and spend it on ads specifically for the purpose of personal branding. Along with it try to find a day job in social media itself. So as you get legible exposure in social media marketing on your resume you also document it and show off your skills in the form of ads. 
I'm not trying to deter you in the slightest, I'm just speaking my thoughts on the situation. Maybe land a internship somewhere to build your craft? Good luck!
Without a degree Im doing a apprenticeship in Marketing.
Ofcourse. Skill is what matters, not degree. 
Google's Data Studio is free and an awesome tool for reporting. I use Supermetrics too (Only about $45/mo) for social and much more. I also use the Supermetrics and Google Analytics plugins for Google Sheets which both integrate with Data Studio along with a bunch of other "connectors" some of which have fees. 
Raw exports of data cleaned up in excel works well too
Knowing YouTube inside and out can't hurt at all. Maybe approach a few ad agencies in your area approach them about hiring you as a freelancer they can tap when needed. Good way to get more clients and build your CV.
Cerifications are proof of knowledge in an area - they're a great addition to a CV/resume for showing credibility, but in digital marketing experience goes a long way. What sounds more impressive? "social media marketing certification from HubSpot" or "successfully managed YouTube channel, garnering **1 million** views." while certifications have their use, the work that you've done so far speaks a lot for itself and is your proof. *professional experience*
Your CV is all about experience. You can either finish formal education or get a side job as you still work as a consultant to add to your resume. Ain't no other way around that, if you want a backup plan.
If you have further questions, feel free to reach out to me.
Man I hate this. I wish my own agency would grow a pair and use client names regardlessly, it’s actually in our contract we can feature creative we produce and use them as campaign examples but whatever.

Also do note that testimonials that could be considered as not truthful, are a cause for manual penalty in the eyes of Google 
Will not work!
I have found the end user has zero confidence in manually entered website testimonials. Pulling them in from google gives so much more trust and power behind them. Put forth more effort into asking clients for reviews. 
So just like kind people advised you here, there is no easy answer to that, because we don't what what are you offering.
It entirely depends upon the business. I would go with Google ads as its approach is more widespread
Google trends for free
I use a system that is probably considered dated but it works for me. It's an RSS board (I have quite a few boards/sheets for different topics) using feeds from websites as well as Google alerts. Not all websites offer RSS but its still useful for scanning and picking out stories. I use a service called Netvibes and the free version. You need to invest time setting up but it's relatively easy to do.
[https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US](https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US) Google trends is always a good tool. 
DO NOT USE Gramto. I tried it out and had too many issues. None of their services ever work, their website is down often, and their customer service teams takes two weeks to respond. Still in the process of trying to get a refund when I initially contacted them for a refund over two weeks ago.
I have tried several different instagram bots and services in my life. The one that best for me is BigBangram, service with auto likes and followers, free proxy, scheduled posting, multiple accounts and so on. Of course i will not use them all, but it nice to have some extra stuff included, especially when it comes to internet marketing strategy. This is best solution for me.
Target interests of things that affluent people like can afford to do. E.G:
Deploy a DSP(Double-click, Sizmek, Amobee, Criteo) in house (agency use is unnecessary) and use 3rd party income data to target the audience with rich media ads. Focus down on premium inventory.

**Example:** If someone arrives at your site from a link that uses this tag, your analytics won't show who referred that link. Instead, it will mistakenly show as direct traffic in your acquisition channels report
**No opener:** the Noreferrer tag has zero impact on **SEO**. Simply put, it operates on the analytics/browser level, not the search engine level. no opener prevents the newly opened page from having the ability to control the page that delivered the traffic and it's highly recommended  to use in your website
I agree with the other poster. I was looking to relocate and basically I think I’d have to restart my career. Marketing is hard because for one you need to know the other country’s language, cultural, social norms, and laws. Secondly, GDPR has changed digital marketing in the EU. I just feel like there are more versatile careers like teaching. 
Your post most likely hit the explore page and took off from there. Instagram works like a set of stairs. Each stair has a number of followers. If your engagement % is high enough on each "step" they will continue showing it to your followers and also potentially put it on the explore page for particular hashtags (different for everybody). 
 The Instagram Explore Page is going to one of the best places to find viral content within your niche.
Yep, there are a ton: Experian (Mosaic), Claritas (Psycle), Nielsen (Audience Segments). But they all cost money. 
I can't speak to any Freeware or publicly available software like the ones you named.  I've seen some software for automotive that absoultely does work and can identify on avg 50%+ of anonymous traffic down to name, email, phone, address, google map, age, income level, etc.  In some instances I've seen it capture 90%+ of the anonymous visitors to a site and provide this data on them.  However, once you have the data on anonymous consumers who are visiting your site you really need to tread carefully on how you market to them.
Tools vary and can change by time. Facebook could die in the next 5 years and some other social media platform takes over.
What you will learn is the theory and concepts behind digital marketing. As another comment suggests, familiarise yourself with tools including Google Analytics, Search Console, Facebook Ads, Google Ads, etc...
Granted, this is assuming you don’t have some sort of platform specific lead campaign where the conversion is a lead form that is filled out in the platform and in that case platform reporting is fine. 
As an omni channel agency one of the things we do in an audit is make sure all of the data is flowing correctly which leads to confirmations pixel/trackers are firing. Sometimes hard coded pixels fall off.
The problem with single platform conversion tracking when the data is siloed, doesn't communicate and isn't transparent is you're most likely missing out on cross platform attribution and consumer journey efficiencies.
Personally I use the conversion metric in Facebook, google ads etc. but I set all my campaign or goals on the outcome; Filled in a form and Made a purchase these things are not always caught by this method. 
I work for an agency that only does social ads. However some of our clients are running other digital marketing campaigns. We provide them with the metrics from Facebook's platform, but we've had an issue in the past where they say it doesn't match their GA. I told them that GA conversions are attributed to the most recent platform.. but is there a way to indicate in GA that this conversion ALSO was served a Facebook ad?
Would creating a GA url with UTM tracking help indicate that this visitor originated from Facebook? Even if they click the Facebook ad, but then convert after doing a google search a few days later?
I guess - face to face meeting from internet are hard esp through comments. But google is the answer to everything. 
Use trial and error to learn and be open-minded 
I would love this too.. I live in an area where there aren't meetups
3: Digital marketing is so freaking easy. Unlike traditional marketing, digital marketing is all related to advertisement and speaking about ads, it's all online ads. Go google a thing or two about online ads and how it works specifically on different platforms will help you understand the foundation of Digital marketing. 
5: Last but not least, it's all about the experience. Find what works and stick right to it. Always remember, different environment/circumstances require different kinds of digital marketing strategy. So keep on backtesting and keep the data in excel. That way, you know how to tackle different projects with a set of proven strategies. 
Pixar has a cute 404 not found page. Also GitHub has geek out with the error message over a mouse rollover. 
I didn't think Yext was worth the money. I'd recommend WhiteSpark or finding them yourself.
Digital marketing is an all encompassing term that can mean a variety of tactics used to increase consumer interest.
It would generally include Search Engine Marketing, Search Engine Optimization, display advertisements, social media ads, reputation management, influencers, email marketing, CRM, video advertisements, websites, content/asset creation, online chat, call tracking, digital retailing...  There are always new forms of online marketing, tagging, media, and reporting technology coming out.
I think the next growth sector in the digital marketing industry is data science.
"conversion rate optimisation"
and the list goes on.
Try to focus on one and master it. Or you might end up dabbling here and there without actually specialising in anything. Just my 2 cents.
If you want someone offshore, you can PM, I worked as a digital marketing manager for 2.5 years in my country and now I am working from home.
There is also the possibility that you can hire an intern to handle your social media and allocate more media budget for conversions/leads.
Concepts haven't really changed. Mediums have, access to data has improved, but understanding fundamental concepts have not.
Also, networking with classmates and professors is unbelievably important. I've never gotten a job from just applying -- always a reference, thanks to my networking in college and after.
People can say what they learned in school was "helpful", but the reality is that digital marketing is results based, so as long as you get results that is all that matters. 
I'm also curious. When I went to school for Marketing we only had a Digital Marketing course 4 years ago. I can't see Digital Marketing courses being very resourceful because all the info would have to continuously be updated.
Subscribe to blogs, follow industry leaders to stay up to date on trends.
It was worth mainly because of my surroundigs. The only thing you learn from all courses, was how to survive in sertaine circumstanses created by proffesors and get a degree) The most usefull things which i learned was lectures with professors and teachers who owned their own bussiness and could give real cases and knowlege. I think it's common situation for everyone nowdays....
I don't think so.
If you want to do a marketing course, you can opt for an online course. You can join a company a start working to get hands-on experience.
I'm relatively early in my career, but I think there's a niche out there for people who can do both. Digital marketing can be a bit technical, and having someone around who knows the tech side can save a lot of time and headache. 
I found it easiest to start with SEO. Since I was already doing web development, SEO was little more than learning some basic "best practices" while making websites. From there you can get into analytics, targeting, CRMs, etc.
There is always a need for CS or Engineers in Digital Marketing.  There seems to be a shortage of employees who are both technical, and capable of client/account management/biz dev.  Most of the CS/Engineering people I work with are kept pretty far away from clients.  There is a lot of money to be made for the CS/Engineer who can also do biz dev.
I do this.  I've been doing it for 10+ years and I'm always in demand.  I have been able to add a lot of value wherever I go and career wise I am very happy I took this path.  I'm pretty senior now, but every once and a while I get to write code or sql to solve and it's like a super power to those that don't have any idea where to start.
A lot of marketing these days has very technical plumbing, so being able to understand how to read API docs, the underlying data structures that are in place etc. go a long way towards being successful.
I've got a degree in CS and I'm pursuing a full time career as digital marketer. I was running a number of blogs back when I started doing CS, so naturally I was inclined towards SEO and Adsense. That brought me a step closer to this field. Later on, I kickstarted my own webdesign company and needed to do plenty of marketing to generate sales. So these early experienced really helped me in the career. Down the road, I did get pretty much acquainted with most of the industry tools, marketing techniques and copywriting. 
I'm a die hard Unbounce fan. I like the content they create (that's what originally drew me to them as a content marketer) I think their platform is super flexible, easy to use, and way more affordable than something like Lead Pages. I never cared for Lead Pages. Besides the price, it wasn't nearly as easy to customize the pages, add scripts, etc. 
Have recently tried almost every one of them but none convinced me. Now I am using Wix to do landing pages and it works quite well.
I like the UX, options and elements that are available. Maybe not the obvious choice but can work out pretty good.
Is this not the same thing really though? I've always done both. It actually can get to the point where we had to hire a social person to do the grind work under me.
You just have to pay a one time fee of $50 instead of paying $19.00 a month or $50 a month for the same results. If you want to learn more let me know.
I've been dealing with this problem for the last 3 months in Canada. Unfortunately legitscript doesn't extend to Canada so we've been using FB and Bing along with other marketing practices
What got me the expert status was watching all the recorded webinar. But I think they are reserved only for customers. You can look up Pardot Webinars on google and land on their site.
I recently started using Pardot and have found it difficult to find quality information on how to accomplish certain things on the platform. It is much easier if you have access to the tool, but if you don't, you can learn the fundamentals by looking at the documentation. Trailblazer is also a great way to learn, but as another user mentioned, I believe you can only access it by purchasing Pardot. I have other suggestions for you if you already have access to Pardot, so let me know if you do.
Often 3-5% of revenue in retail, but it does vary depending on the lifecycle of the business. 
Not exactly the same, but I had to make a press release and a flier for a low level marketing job. I was stressed out about not having enough info, but in the end I had to tell myself that as long as you are showing off your abilities and can justify your decisions it doesn't matter if the details are perfect.
Granted, I didn't get another interview, but at least the work got done.
All that is to  say, they probably just want to see what you can do and that you know what you're talking about. Keep that in mind and don't sweat the details. Hope that helps!
Don't stress! They know you don't have enough information. If it makes you feel better, you can always add a page that lists the assumptions you had to make, and why you chose to make the ones you did.
Practical tasks like this help separate people who know what they're talking about from people who are very good at presenting themselves, but might have less hands-on ability.
* Where are you getting the benchmark data from?  
Any advertising and marketing has a very low floor and very high ceiling.
For you. Engagements, cost per engagement, and relevance score.
So cost per like, cost per share, and CPM is what you should focus on. 
Also keep in mind to always watch your Frequency. There’s a direct correlation between a higher frequency with higher cost per results. 
I usually switch up creatives/audiences once my frequency hits 3.5 
CTR = cost per click = How many people do click ads
you may check semrush or similarweb, they give some ideas about traffic and geo details even if you dont have control on that website.
Look into Hitwise, it's estimated data but it's pretty spot on for general trends in traffic and search volume etc 
First, need to install Analytics tools that can track data, so u got real data to back up your story.
Setup Google Tag Manager, Google Analytic Goal, Facebook Pixel, Ghostery, Create Google Dashboard with Google Spreadsheet that auto update the stats, Track your conversion by masking your link with Google Campaign URL Builder, Setup Hotjar, Make sure you the whole funnel is setup before driving traffic or measuring it, e.g Autoresponder setup that won't complete with analytic setup within the Autoresponder. On the site you want to predict traffic
Ok, after setup, then you need to setup campaign to drive traffic
You can track your traffic strategy effectiveness by testing the ads quality, the landing page element, and the target audience. so u have to run some test campaign, to see if your strategy yield result. U need to do a lot of testing to devise a proven system that you can confident offer your traffic solution.
you could do this via Google Ads using the keyword tool but that's only an estimate. As you start to run campaigns you'll discover more keywords will should increase the traffic.
You cannot make a solid estimate for this, just a informed guess
Capture and present anything you think shows strong engagement and if you have sales data attributed to social then even better.
Maybe look at each campaign or month by month and present stats for that. There's so many ways of doing it.
What would YOU want to see if someone were showing you their profile?
If you have set up Facebook pixel and Google Analytics Goal, you can track your conversion rate. If u created a Google Dashboard with Google Spreadsheet u can find helpful data there.
Use similarweb.com Facebook and Google Analytics to get meaningful stats related to your efforts.
Eg which link is inbound link to client website? Was it from your social post? What is the engagement rate?
You gotta just commit to switching. I finally did it at the beginning of July. After about 2 weeks of frustration I got the hang of it, and now prefer it. Just do it. There are necessary features in there that you are missing out on. Do. It.
I was just discussing this with my SVP when he called me up for navigation help while lurking one of our campaigns. The new change seems less “Google friendly, intuitive design”  initially (IMO) but it’s starting to vibe with me.
it feels too much like a CRM system like salesforce to me - but I am using it now - it's not that bad and certainly quicker to load and apply changes. That old Java interface was laid out perfectly but was very clunky
I think I prefer the new interface for the most part. There were a couple of features I couldn't find and ended up switching back for but on the whole I do like the new look.
But I tend to do my ads in Editor and pull everything into Data Studio so I don't need to use it that much anyway now. 
Experience, digital marketing is about experience. Do not fall victim to credentialism. Figure out what you want to do in marketing. Understand what you’ll need to break into that role and then build out your portfolio of that work. Google and analytics are enough, now seriously focus on experience. 
Marketing is all about showing you can do the work not certifications. 
I've been looking into this recently as well. So far I've narrowed it down to The Digital Marketing Institute which has an online Post Graduate Diploma in Digital Marketing programme and Full Sail which has an Internet Marketing Degree. I've actually been in advertising/digital marketing for over 10 years but pretty much got my foot in the door and worked my way up. Now transitioning from head of digital in an ad agency to a digital marketing manager at an international bank. In my case experience alone got me pretty far but my new employer is saying I have to get certified. So basically experience is great but getting properly certified is necessary too depending on your career path. 
You can’t fight Google’s mobile push. It is what is is, and it’s better to go with the flow and try to make your site mobile friendly instead of fighting it and being punished. It’s not really fair but they are the 800 lb gorilla, so when they say jump you say how high.
Yes, our target market may prefer to view datasheets on a big screen and probably does a lot of searching on desktop computers because it happens during work hours.
But that is no excuse to not make your site mobile friendly. Use a framework that is responsive and you won’t need to maintain separate desktop and mobile sites. About 15% of my traffic is mobile now. It doesn’t do me any good to say “these people should be finding me on a desktop!”, it’s better to serve them well with whatever device they use to find you.
However, I think it’s best to make your site mobile friendly and let your customers tell you how they want to view your content.
But still check for license before posting the image, just in case. 
Even if you don't expect any legal ramifications, it's just a bad thing to do. If your startup grows big, you do not want something as minor as this to come bite you in the ass.
A site that I find very helpful is Unsplash[dot]com, all images are free on this site.
Well it's an year now, no money in sight 😖
2 months since starting my company, but I did have connections with my first client. My biggest barriers are the general outlook on digital marketing and competing with the teenaged daughters of business owners (since they view what they do and professional digital marketing to be the same thing). 
3. People that sign up late or want the interviews immediately can pay for the "Congress Package" with all interviews in video & audio, as well as an ebook with the 10 best lessons from each interview in textform and bonuses the experts gave you to give the viewers (those are only available in the paid package). IMPORTANT: The package costs way less while the congress is live and will increase to the "original/normal" price afterwards. The scarcity for live-events is among the biggest I've seen for a product launch of any kind. We went with 87€ reduced and 247€ normal.
5. Win-Win-Win. (a) The Experts get tons of exposure, as well as 50% of every sale they generate via their affiliate-links (which also drives most of the traffic and sales; 60% in our case). (b) The viewers get expert-interviews on their topic for free, if they take the time to watch them live. (c) you get a huge list, instant expert-status and loads of money from the congress package sales.
Fiverr is the worst place to find clients for digital marketing.
Check out Marketo's template as well. Similar to Hubspot but a nice update. 
Let me know if this was helpful or if you need more assistance.
I would start working in Google Data Studio, you can use the demo data connectors and build some awesome reports. It is a free product and makes for a great talking point during any Digital Marketing interview as it is one of the newer products, which means that not every agency has someone who knows how to use it — making you that much more valuable.  
I would definitely look at social media management. Look for small restaurants and other stores in your local area. I guarantee a few have terrible pages you can help with. You just need a couple and you can easily bring in 24K (2K/month). 
***what will get you paid right away working from your laptop(that you can learn in a week)***
* video editing
* social media page management(posting, content creation)
open two web browsers, if you have windows drag one to the left side of the screen with youtube videos on it showing you exactly how to do one thing you want to learn.
PS: my bro is a electrician
As someone who's been in the industry for a few years, it shouldn't be hard to reach that level. However, it is extremely competitive even though demand is high (the demand is usually for low paying jobs).
Keep in mind that data is king in this industry so that's what I would stick to, if I were you.
If you have an industry vertical that you know well (like home renovation) and you have contacts with a bunch of contractors, reach out to them and set up meetings with them over lunch. Learn how to put together a basic proposal and think about pricing (which can be tricky).
See if you can sign up some clients to provide basic marketing services -- SEO/reputation management, paid social, SEM. Keep the products/solutions simple and don't overpromise results. Make sure you agree to a setup fee if you're doing a ton of work up front! Don't just charge a % of media spend if you're going to be putting in 35 hours of work in the first few weeks. Also incentivize them to upgrade their spend with you and don't worry so much about the exact level of the management fee at first. You'll make way more off a client that stays with you for a year and pays 15% vs one that pays 30% but only lasts two months. 
Most marketers I know do this, and I do work at a fairly large agency. You generally just need to be careful that you’re not competing with your agency (particularly if you signed a non-compete) and I’d recommend staying away from your agency’s verticals entirely if possible. You also should avoid anything unethical, like working with your agency’s former clients or offering your services to a client on the side. Finally, you have to be very careful to keep your day job and your side job separate — any side work should not be done on agency time. So in other words, no bringing your personal laptop into work to do side projects; it’s a bad idea to do this at work even if you’re on your lunch break. And yes, if it becomes known to your direct supervisor that you have side clients, your behavior and communications will probably be more closely scrutinized, so be prepared for that. 
I don’t care if it’s frowned upon or not, you have bills to pay. Freelance as much as you can and don’t tell anybody about it. Also, do you think the founders of your current agency wouldn’t have “hustled” and made money on the side if they weren’t paid enough at their job? You’re only useful to them if you make them money otherwise they’ll fire you without a care in the world. Have to look out for yourself. 
Just curious ( because I was one step from moving to the UK last year , and look for a  PPC entry level job ) . How much are these jobs paying ? Is it worth it ? Are they hard to find?
Agree with jackduluoz007. You can do it, but be careful. In addition to his points, Don't use any work tools to freelance. So if you have access to social media monitoring tools at work, you shouldn't use them for freelancing, even if it's outside of work hours. You really want to keep both gigs completely separate. But if you can do that, it shouldn't be a problem. 
If your contract doesn't have a non-compete clause, go for it. If that clause is there, smart agency owners will be ok with it. My last job knew, and that actually referred me some clients that weren't a fit for the agency. 
I wouldn’t do it unless you need the money. You will be paranoid everyday thinking they might find out.
When I started freelancing, I posted on different forums to do free of cost campaign preparation in exchange for testimonial/reference. If the customer approved my work, I stayed on board for a week and help fine tune the campaign for them.  No charges for my services except for a healthy testimonial. If they liked my services to continue, I offered my services on a retainer. After 3 weeks, I had 9 campaigns prepared and 3 full time customers. One of which eventually became a full time employer.
They are right though you really don't know shit unless you're running campaigns.
I could start you off with a free Google AdWords basics courses. I don’t want to sound promotional . If you need the url I could share it . 
That comes down to what interest you. It's not that difficult to land a digital position, you just need to show you have the willingness to learn, have the skills to help grow a business and that you know what you're supposed to do. 
I work as a Digital Marketer at a digital agency in Perth. I managed SEM, SEO and social for a bunch of large government clients, as well as some smaller ones.
I run a digital marketing course with an intensive SEO unit that covers practical skills and strategies that I use to help rank clients websites higher in Google. If you're interested, I can give you a voucher code so you can access it for free to help you out. Just shoot me a PM :)
I would consider scaling back the social media presence. I think the Facebook is an obvious first choice for a social media but ask yourself if the other SM platforms are necessary. I work in Marketing for a financial group and I am always approached by coworkers to set up Instagram to which I reply, “what would we post that will gain traction?”. Perhaps ask yourself that “what could I post that would gain meaningful engagement that could turn into business”. If you can’t answer that, it may not be the place to spend your time or energy. 
Claim his Google my business listing and other important business listings on Bing, Yelp, etc. Respond to reviews, solicit new ones from happy customers. I agree with the guy about scaling back social media, Facebook is enough and it's pay to play. Adwords will get him more actual customers.
You have done the right things so far. Learn more about SEO and more particularly the local seo process. Understand the competition in your niche and develop a strategy accordingly. Also focus on the socialmedia platforms to increase visibility and optimize it.
Definitely look into Google my business. It provides a lot of help, especially when you are barely starting out. As far as SEO, the most basic thing to do is create citations for the company. There is a lot of sites that allow you to create them for free and helps you rank in google locally. Best of luck! If you need any more detail answer contact me directly. :) 
I started using [DashThis](https://dashthis.com) earlier this year and I love it. Very easy to set-up reports and our clients have a place they can see their data up to date all the time. I also like the fact that it can blend data together from different channels, very helpful.
Take a look at NinjaCat. It isn’t cheap but it is amazingly flexible. 
Facebook ads is a must-have skill for most of digital media positions, so you'll have to master it anyway. 
DCM/DBM are more sofisticated but not suitable in every environment. Great skills to have, though.
Facebook advertising isn't rocket science. Great to know, but won't set your world on fire. Keep a broad range of skills up your sleeve and don't place all your worth in a niche.
Learn both, especially if you are in a media / advisory agency as your role would be to recommend the best tool suited for the client's purpose.
Great idea!
Hey I miss the daily recaps 
All of that is in the “easy to learn, difficult to master” category. The good news is in one dedicated month you should be able to talk about it convincingly enough to land an entry level job.
Google have free Digital marketing courses, I think one is [digital garage](https://learndigital.withgoogle.com/digitalgarage/) another one is [Google partner Certification](https://www.google.com/partners/about/). You can also go for [Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/academy/course/6) training from google. etc...
But main thing to keep in mind while you do DMS is End Customer Centric approach, else after all these effort, you will be posting in social media and spending money in google ads without a clear idea. 
And one month is not a good time line, You can do one month intense study and update every day for the rest of your life. 
Literally just get google analytics certified and if you are feeling ambitious get Facebook Blue Print certification. You can easily do that in a month and will help you enormously 
Hey, getting certified in Google Adwords can be very helpful and it's free! Also, the company I work for conveniently has this guide for how to use Facebook Ads and talks all about Facebook advertising in general. 
Maybe it can help you: https://blog.rocketlevel.com/how-to-advertise-on-facebook-a-guide-for-small-businesses
It is possible to learn quite a bit and be knowledgeable enough to get an entry-level job, but you'll need to keep practicing and studying long after that month to truly become an expert. 
Def watch youtube videos, follow marketing websites/podcasts and take the certifications. Just don't rely solely on saying you have certifications, they help, but its more about your knowledge and being able to execute/think creatively over a piece of digital paper saying you know it. 
same situation.. :/
I have put together a site where you could enrol and get the initial push. DOn't worry this is not an attempt to push any courses down people's throat. It's a free resource to make digital marketing very actionable and practical for everyone.
Just enrol and get FREE access to the sessions here: https://courses.titans.digital
*"I spent 3.5 years of my life falsely believing I'm a 'digital marketer' when all* **I ever did was copywriting** *and seeing other people do things like FB ads and google ads."*
Not to put copywriting in a bad light.  It is after all the most important Part of a webpage but...
but But BUT!...
Not having **control** over your copy: well, that freaking sucks!
You've gotta have your hands on the actual gears ya know?  Being in control of the full funnel.  Being able to tweak what needs to be tweaked WHEN you want tweak it!
In Brazil, a federal bank is using Watson to allow transactions through facebook messenger chatbot.

Advertising for cannabis products is not allowed on most sites. so, the only way forward is through content marketing. It's interesting, engaging and most importantly, it's legal.

The fear is that ISPs will pursue bandwidth throttling for sites that feature video streaming services. Theoretically, there's a fear that you can lose leads if you currently run display or video ads on YouTube and the ISPs slow down users' download rates to push them onto a premium account. However, it could also affect other popular marketing channels depending on whatever speed packages ISPs put together. It's all hypothetical at the moment but I remain confident that whatever happens, short of taking out the entire web, the technology is flexible enough to adjust your digital strategy accordingly. 
If you want a paid gig with some feedback, and a possible future recommendation, let me know. I have a small agency and my intern just left to go out into the world and a freelancer I use to write a few blogs for our smaller clients is on extended medical absence. I prefer to work with people that show initiative and have experience in the world beyond marketing.
would pay peanuts (like $50 per blog post) because the client I have in mind was the guy who sold me my house and I gave him a huge discount on everything from his website and that's basically what he pays us. But it will at least be a live website and some on the job training.
You won’t have an issue and don’t need costly training. Use the good free resources. Most colleges really haven’t caught up. I’ve used very little from my marketing degree in actual digital marketing work. Plus with journalism background you can go into the content side quite well.
Yes, work from home is appealing. It is good to have a certification and online courses are worth the investment.
You can learn the basics from YouTube videos https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN-rPSim-zOSUkxOIg7lIw/videos and online courses at https://cerealentrepreneur.academy
Get some work experience from freelancing sites like upwork. This will help you to apply what you have learnt during the course.
Hubspot and saleforce offer free training. Google Ad Academy (I think is the new name for it, they switched last week) offers training and their certifications are free and are sought after.
I have a heavy software development background and just transitioned into digital marketing, I'm still a little bit behind the curve strategy wise but there are a ton of resources out there that you don't have to pay for. You don't have to have a marketing degree to enter the field.
I recently jumped into marketing with no marketing experience and with a Bachelor’s in an unrelated field, Spanish and International Studies. You can use your previous experience to transition to a marketing role in that field, let’s say something culinary related. In my case, I worked in law firms for years doing all sorts of things (litigation, management, etc.), and when a marketing role came up at a law firm, I applied and got it. Your journalism experience will help you stand out, too. Also, sign up for Lynda.com and start taking a bunch of marketing classes. It’s just like $30/month. Those classes show up automatically on your LinkedIn profile. Good luck!
There is a huge difference in pay, but expats definitely get better rates than locals.

Split test those 2 audiences? You have a variable subset & the control group. Test the hypothesis & the field.
Conversion optimization is extremely powerful and scalable.
Data Analysis is a big one. Many things will change when it comes to CRO over the next few years as the digital ad world changes. Same with conversion optimization. We can't really expect folks to keep filling out forms for the next 10 years. That process is going to change so much.
Cyfe can do this and it's very cheap. 
Google Analytics, OpenSite Explorer, Majestic, BuzzStream, Canva, Sumo - the list goes on and on. I dont mind paying for tools either

Absolutely not. Do the (free) online certifications for Adwords, Bing and Hubspot. There are add-ons that mean you can get actual certification for these. But college for digital marketing would be a waste of time. You'd be far better off getting an internship in a digital marketing company. Or better yet, a digital marketing start-up. They won't be looking for anyone with any sort of technical background - just somebody who is willing to do whatever needs to be done to get a job.
To work for someone else, definitely.  But there are so many online courses that are not offered through an actual online university from actual real marketers who are making real waves in the industry.  Digital Marketing is forever changing. Every few months.  Thats why digital marketing is so heavily undervalued. Guys who 've placed ads in dying formats like Newspaper and TV for the last 40 years typically have no idea how to effectively create ads for Facebook that work.  
Here's what I like to do. It's sort of based in the inbound methodology. If you don't know what that is I suggest you look it up. 
1. Define a target audience
1. Where do they hang out online?
Mary is a 38 year old mother with 2 kids, a boy and girl who both go to school. Mary's day starts at 6am when she has to ready the kids and prepare breakfast for the family, before taking them to school. After dropping them off, she comes home to do some chores and then sits on the sofa to watch some tv while browsing Facebook and having a think about what to cook for dinner before she makes a trip to the grocery store. Deciding what to make for dinner is one of her pain points as her husband and children like different things, and they can never agree on what to eat. 
So now we know a fair bit about our target audience. It's time to think about what they'll engage with.
Maybe we only add recipes in the ebook that require lots of chopping and cutting of ingredients. Then we could send a follow up email a week later, which targets a pain point that she didn't know she had. "The new knife co knife that'll cut your cooking time in half". 
She clicks the CTA and visits a sales page which is also optimized with high converting content. She buys a knife, thus ending the buyer cycle.
This is content management and, in my mind at least, this is the best strategy for content marketing. 
There are many ways to make effective content marketing strategies:
3. Add subheadings to your content. Subheadings will break your content into module and will make it more understandable to users.
4. Create a content in step wise procedure. If the content is in flow, it will help users more to read further without any confusion.Under the Title, begin your content with how it will help your customers. It will generate an interest.
6. Add proper interlinks, if customers want to go in detail. Sentences should be short and precise and content should be broken into small paragraphs.
Never taken that course but I would like to hear from someone who has!
I think there's a trend in marketing automation to enable tighter alignment between sales and marketing.  For example, Salesforce acquiring Pardot.  Whether it's happening and at what rate is probably highly dependent on a lot of variables.  
I'm in B2B IT and Telecom and sales/channel alignment is a growing trend but on the ground the actual implementation and adoption of these practices is really still in its infancy.  Our industry is heavily dependent on a channel sales model and there's an entire industry growing around software that brings marketing together with channel, e.g., Zift Solutions, MindMatrix.  
My industry has, in the past decade, taken a consultative sales approach but a huge portion of the research stage of the buyers journey is happening online before the lead even gets to a sales rep, where those buyers used to rely heavily on the sales reps for information.  This makes it that much more important for companies to have a solid inbound strategy that gets top-of-funnel content in front of the buyers early in the process, and to give reps visibility into the journey that buyer took before they got to the rep, because where they once had the chance to probe and uncover pain points and position their solution, they're now having a very different conversation where the buyer is educated by the time they engage. 
So, I think think sales and marketing are becoming more aligned, and I think that's the role inbound has in driving that behavior, and I think marketing automation is the key to the execution of that alignment.

Definitively agree on that. Our tool also looks to automate the inbound process of lead generation in a way. 
There are no shortcuts to conversion. The simplest way is to remove the decimals and divide by the corresponding power of 10. That is 3.33 = 333/100 or .75 = 75/100 = 3/4... This is fairly basic and I don't see how they can make this harder.
I am not sure what the agency has in mind. Which position are they hiring for? DM
Maybe they just want to make sure you're not a complete idiot?
I love being part of the content creation process. Finding creative ways to share ideas is really cool. I want endless resources so I could do insane things
I am working in the field of digital marketing, specially SEO field and I love it :D
It's been a really cool journey which has ended up with me and a few mates running a small home digital agency which has been very fun. 
I didnt really choose my career path. I fell into a role that also included a small amount of social management. With time, It just became so interesting, understanding customer psychology and finding new ways to communicate. For me Social is the right amount of creative and the right amount of technical. I honestly feel like this is what i am supposed to be doing. 
yes, i love, eat and breathe digital marketing.
I have marketed apps for B2C and B2B in my past and am not sure if you're following any process at this point. I'll see if I can break down my day to day without knowing specific knowledge of your target demographic, preferred channels, or strategies that you have already noticed worked for you. 
Before going further, I'd like to clarify one piece of knowledge that was shared with me very early on about digital marketing: Typical digital marketers implement marketing tactics hoping that they work or "sticks". Great Digital Marketers, on the other hand, follow a process founded on data that either proves or disproves a marketing strategy. This is how I structured my day to day and here's how it would usually play out. 
The spray and pray methodology doesn't work in digital and if you're still doing that in your company, it needs to stop. Instead, I approached every single marketing strategy with a systematic and scientific methodology that helped me increase my ROI and save some serious time & money from bad campaigns. 
By definition, the scientific method provides a systematic way for you to solve a question by making observations and continuously experiment. The entire concept focuses on repeat experimentation in order to understand variables to ultimately lead to a predictable outcome. 
3) Once you've identified the experiment, think of how you will measure all of your experiment KPIs based on your objective. Make sure you state your hypothesis and all of your KPIs serve to either prove or disprove your hypothesis. A good framework for this is the AARRR Pirate metrics framework on a per experiment basis. Pay particularly close attention to all of the variables that will affect your experiment and make sure you have automated the reporting correctly. In our company, this depended on the strategy we picked and we ended up building quite a few templates for KPIs that we could use as a basis. If you would like help here, shoot me a message. 
Alert me when CPC = $20.00
7) Monitor and analyze your results consistently. If you can, have the spreadsheet open in a screen in the office 24x7 so that you (or someone in your team) can always look at it. To analyze your results, simply ask yourself why the experiment worked (or didn't work). Identify the key variables that led to the success/failure so that you can make tweaks. 
8. If the experiment was a success, apply your findings, and scale the experiment in iterative steps. Continue to focus on the marketing channel until it's not as successful. 
Do the web a favor and please fire your web designer. Few people will put in the effort of trying to decipher light text on a light background. I bounced from the page within 4 seconds.  
Behavior targeting would drive more conversions than interest targeting.  Spending more money targeting the right consumer is much more profitable than increasing clicks and shares (unless that's what you're going for)
This was really insightful. Thanks!
Audiences are tired of being blasted sales or always being told what to do. Make things organic and find ways to connect with your audience. Engage with your followers and see what they like, don't like and what they do other then listen to your music.
Now it's time to start focusing on the audience, who they are and what they like
And remember, you are listening but not listening too hard.
The audience should never totally dictate what your brand does unless that is in your marketing strategy.
Business intelligence and proper sales attribution/data management. It has a barrier to entry and every other type of marketing can benefit from it so I think this is a big one.
Then there are platforms that still will grow and improve: Reddit (?), Pinterest, Amazon paid to name a few
I would say 1:1 personal marketing is becoming more of a trend, but the tools to achieve this are still quite complex so not many digital marketers are skilled in this area.
I mean everyone knows content marketing but I feel it fits here
Jobs concerning computational Challenges, to more importantly, the moral and philosophical ramifications this advanced technology will have; specifically, Societal Ramifications endured from misuse & abuse.
Zapier. It's a fucking life saver.
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:
- [/r/ppc] [Google trends keyword research match types?](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/bkbbec/google_trends_keyword_research_match_types/)
We had this come up recently. Client runs a local business improvement district. 
Normally, we always say no to this kind of request. 
However, this client has been working with our company for 10+ years and referred many qualified leads over that time, so we said yes. They pay a monthly retainer for ~4 hours of my time. After a basic training session or two, I audit their campaigns before they go live and offer suggestions. 
This client has always been great to work with, and it has been a great arrangement so far. They insist they are a 3/10 on the tech savvy scale but are in fact 7/10. I could see this arrangement being an absolute nightmare in many other situations. 
Hope that helps!
Ask to be paid by the hour. Why not? If not you then they'll pay someone else to teach them.
I do a variation of this with certain clients. I work with several law firms, and some of the solo or small firms have more time than budget available. I charge for account setup and include a list of weekly and monthly tasks. I also offer 2 hours per month to check on the account and provide suggestions or make changes in the account. This works for the firm, as the save money while generating leads and I gain their trust while displaying my expertise. Then when the client gets too busy and gets solid ROI they have me take over the account. This is good for both pof us. They can dip their toes in, learn and understand the strategy of Google Ads and end up being a more informed and better client to work with. Both sides win. 
But I also filter out clients that I feel I won't get along with, so I don't work with everyone who wants to do this type of arrangement.
If they won't give you access to the Google Ads account and all you want to do is review their keyword selection, get the client to export a list of their keywords including match types and any other metrics you need.
Go to Google Ads > Ads & extensions > Remove all columns so there is no data > Download.
The best you can do in that situation is use a tool like SEMrush to see what keywords their ads show for check their ads/landing pages.
They clearly have no idea how google ads works.
I am exactly the same. I hate not being able to see the full picture of the company. Anytime this happens I always have to go back and google to go to the main page. Annoys the living shit out of me.
I actually believe that less options means less time to think. But there are tons of ways to apply this idea to a website. So boldly suggesting "removing menu buttons" might not work for most of the web sites. 
I suggest you to track your page views with tools like hot jar, and modify places where they leave.
Yes. You are. If you are looking for pricing, while the consultation is free, it means the landing page is not done well. The visitor is suppose to feel that they have nothing to lose taking up the free consultation while the consultation would be able to solve their problem.
Don't spend your money yet. It's not there. At least online. Your products are the same as everyone else's, from what I could find on your website. But that's totally fine. Looks like you're trying to create a lifestyle brand, not a product line. $800 isn't enough to do that, though. You need some organic work.
Work with people on Instagram, give them product and have them post about it. Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc. All the same. Find people who have the audience that you want to target and work with them. 
Your website also needs a lot of work to make this happen. Took some digging to find your purpose. And there's not a ton of text on the homepage. There are some broken links, no blog/community that I could see, and not a ton in the way of people promoting your lifestyle in your brand. This might be another area to spend some coin - get a photographer to do a lifestyle shoot for you. 
I do these things for startups all the time. Let me know if you need help with anything.
2. Why would you run ads for a company, that is attached to your personal or business account? Each company HAS to have its own business page so that you can run ads through these pages. Ads are shown with the business attached. It would make no sense to promote a product, with the ad being shown through your facebook page.
3. I would do A LOT more testing and research before you sign any clients that you are going to be running ads for. If you are not an expert, or very informed, you will have unhappy clients. Unhappy clients lead to bad reviews. Bad reviews lead to no business. No business leads to you working a shitty job that you hate.
4. Add the client Ad Accounts for the aforementioned pages to business manager. This is the same as above. If you already have access to it, you can just add it right in. If not, you can request access to the ad account using the ad account ID. Client will need to approve these kinds of requests.
5. If the client doesn't have an ad account yet, walk them through setting one up, then request access to it. You will only have a certain number of ad accounts you can create from within business manager on behalf of clients, so its good to have them do this themselves so you don't max out.
7. IMPORTANT: Set up auto-delivered reports of campaign stats to be delivered to you at regular intervals. If a client pulls the plug (only real downside of organizing everything this way is that the client usually still has full control and authority over everything) you will lose access to historical data - no good if you're trying to prove the value of the service you're providing and need to reference stats.
With business manager you can work in one single user interface, and manage all of your various assets - Facebook pages, ad accounts, audience insights, audience builders, payment methods, etc. That's what it was built for. You can also grant access to employees (and revoke it if need be) and provided different levels of access for different people. There's no reason not to use it. Like I said, it was built for that.
When you set up a campaign the first few times you are going to have a make a bunch of decisions you really didn’t think about before and might not understand. 
Not to hijack this thread but any advice on how to run A/B tests on FB?
Before I created my A/B tests on Facebook, I used Optimizely's sample size calculator and found I needed a sample size of 70,000 per variation to reach 95% statistical significance. While I was setting up my campaigns, Facebook said the potential reach will be 430,000 so I thought I was safe.
What am I doing wrong & how could I avoid this next time? Thanks in advance for your help.
You do need to have a gmb set up and running ofc.
Have you left a review in the past? Google will use that previous experience to get you to leave more reviews. It will also take into account the amount of time spent at a location to then determine whether you stayed there long enough to actually use the business.
Google does that automatically, I seems to happen more for a reviewer with a lot of reviews marked as helpful. I wish there was a way to reach out to "helpful" reviewers and invite to the location, but I don't think Google shares that data. Someone smart might be able to scrape that info from r/LocalGuides. "Please review us on Google" signage could get the ball rolling, raffles for review, etc...
If you're an SEO professional offering SEO services, you need to be using the paid tools, in general. There's a reason they cost money. I don't really use any free tools, except gtmetrix or builtwith.com
Look on a site called "siftery'
Ubersuggest by Neil Patel, they just added a bunch of new features.
Depending on how large your agency is, make sure their manager is mentoring them, having regular check-ins with them, and giving feedback on their work. Also give them a "buddy" who isn't their manager/ideally outside of their direct department/team who they grab coffee with regularly. This allows the interns to have a more informal relationship with someone who can answer questions they might be too embarrassed to ask their manager. I'm an intern-turned full time employee at an agency, so feel free PM me if you have any questions! Happy to talk.
Get certified in Google Analytics and Adwords. My interviewer was impressed that I was certified in one of those. You can also work with a recruiter to help you get a job. I'm in the same boat as you, all my experience in marketing has been in social media and I'm trying to branch out to other areas of marketing.
As such, I'm looking for someone who either has business contacts or possess good marketing skills to promote my services to potential clients. *Please note that this isn't a job with a fixed rate; rather, we will share the payment after a project is completed.*
Agree with /u/j03c0nn01, fill in the gap with a position of doing your own thing and talk about it as a time for you to discover whether you want to go out on your own or not, and then you can conclude with finding that you missed working with a larger team, etc. and so are returning.
Lived in Melbourne for a while.... doing PPC for Telstra. Maybe see if they are hiring for their offices in CBD. Otherwise, getting a job is about going out and meeting people, networking and finding out about jobs that way. Recruiters are usually the last place I have gone to get a job.
We just did a massive lead source mapping exercise for our new lightning instance not sure what's the best way to share add me on Linkedin? pm me
Yoast is essential, many others vary but I like WP Fastest Cache and Redirection as well. There are so many plugins, but be careful on some as they can cause your site to slow down, affecting SEO. Usually it's those that have javascript to load
Variety of WordPress plugins are available in the market. Everything has its plugin has its own role. 
WordPress SEO by Yoast, SFDC Lead Generation, Broken Link Checker, Google XML Sitemaps many more.
7. What is the current download rate of special publications, eBooks etc. created by the organization?
I'd love to hear what others suggest :)
This is a bit facetious, so apologies, but I’d say it’s a good thing. Turn them off and out some proper tracking in place instead / smart goals are pretty much useless 99% of the time. 
If you want me to take a look at your site and suggest a goal setup feel free to reply here or DM me 👍🏼 
Edit: no charge / sales follow up - just happy to help. 
Why would you even want to use smart goals? Just use custom goals specific to your company or client's goals.
I would master a specific digital marketing skill. People who don’t really understand This field thinks that one person call do it all or know it all about digital. Impossible for one person to be able to do all the aspects of this field. 
Its just the most useful thing, foundational knowledge there opens up so many pathways it hurts.
PPC and SEO. Mostly because the vendors we've used suck, and I feel like I could do it better than them with a little research and testing.
I'm bummed no one else answered because I am wondering the same thing as I'm going to pursue the freelance route. I was thinking of creating a basic website with samples of my work, then I'd be able to just send a link to that/include it on my resume, but was interested to hear what others have done. 
Is this for an agency or an organization? It sounds like organization so I'll tailor response to that:
- Do not be an arrogant dick. What I mean is, be personable and humble. Admit where your knowledge is weak and when you don't know things but express a desire to learn. They don't want you interacting with internal partners or clients talking out of your depth (or ass). It's never bad to say "I don't know, but I'll find out/get in touch with someone on my team better suited to answer this."
Just my two cents. Lots of things to say but if this is entry level and you express some ambition and initiative, your experience or lack thereof won't even come into the equation.
Good Luck! Drop me a private message with how it turns out :)
Simply have the skills that are on the application and be able to demonstrate them and talk about them. 
There are a couple of things that this could be.
If your website loads slow, LinkedIn can register a click, but if the person leaves before your analytics load it can cause this.  
While ad clicks and traffic never match up, anything over a 20% variation is worth looking into.
I noticed the same yesterday. 54 clicks on an ad yet analytics show 20 from LinkedIn. 
Facebook has a very robust reporting API. Learn to make calls and pull the data as needed. If you can’t pay for a solution, this is likely your best option. 
Remindme! 5 hours
I am also looking for a mentor that can help me learn digital marketing.
Honestly, I hate unpaid internships but if you get one at a digital agency of reasonable quality, you will be worth something to them by the end of it and they won’t want to let you go. I recommend starting in PPC because of the fast learning curve, then branch out from there after you’ve conquered the foundational elements.
Shoot me a message, I can help you out, bud!
Link juice coming from a quality website is considered as 'Good Quality Link juice' & link juice coming from low authority website/irrelevant website/porn website is considered as 'Bad quality link juice'.
Higher numbers are better.
Im moving into more monthly retainer deals. 
The way I've been told is you charge by project. But you come up with your price by the hourly pay you want or think you're worth. The problem if you charge a client 15 hours to do a project and you do it instead in 10, they think they're over paying because you spent less time. So you're being punished for being better at your job.
I'm not sure if this is best way to do it, but it's what I've been told. Instead, calculate your project at how many hours it would take (say $100/hour at 15 hours). So your price is now $1500 for the project instead of $100 an hour.
I always prefer set fee / retainer though, because it gives me the opportunity to work a lot less and make more. 
With hourly there’s always the question of why so much per hour (“wait, did you say $195/hr?”) , or why it took so long, as they thought it would only take <insert-ridiculously-short-period-if-time> even though you told them it was a 15 hour job and you only took 12. 
I’ve made the mistake of underpricing myself dramatically and then regretting it when I lost money. 
Now I turn those clients away, to someone else, or have me coach them on how to do it, where to start, etc. Done that a few times, did 60 min strategy sessions at $95/hr
That will likely end up being done as a retainer though. 
If I’m charging a retainer of $3000/mo, I need to make sure the MOST I’m spending in time on that account is like 30 hours. 
There is no one way to bill a client. You can do hourly, day or week rates or even monthly. We do retainer aka monthly and then by the project if it's a large job that will span many monthly for a specific ask.
Depends but we’re trying to move away from billing by the hour. It is a bad, bad idea.
Lots of people here saying they bill by the project. This is something I usually avoid unless the scope is very clear and in a written contract, because otherwise some clients will attempt to turn your agreement into an "all you can eat" buffet. Endless revisions, meetings, changes, etc.
The advantage of Time & Materials is that you will always get paid for the amount you worked, and they won't ever overpay or underpay. It's fair both ways, and you can establish a minimum fee to ensure you always get a certain amount of value regardless of how long it took.
Top Hat Rank is dope. Any agency that has Arsen Rabinovich AND Jesse McDonald is to good to not at least talk to. I can maybe get you a direct connection to get you in touch with the top people there.
P.s. Ask me anything \^\^
Do a usertesting.com test and show him how hard of a time the user has trying to buy on the site. 
That being said, after hearing out his concerns/arguments, I would try to explain why the order things go is important (focusing on the site first and user experience is more important than scaling it with ads). After listening and acknowledging his point of view, I would then explain. Explain that paid ads works as an multiplier for what already happens, so if you have a baseline crappy user experience on your website that is clunky and hard to navigate, you are throwing money away because the website sucks and it wouldn’t convert well. Maybe show him examples from competitor sites for what you want your landing page to look like or walk him through that by navigating your site from a buyer’s perspective and showing him how where your website could be use work. Basically show him what works and how you would get your website to work better.
What is the conversion rate right now?
Where is your current traffic coming from?
The owner of the company I work for has a very much "Just do it" attitude, whereas I like to tick boxes and have a road map. What I've learnt over time is that it's sometimes necessary to go with the flow and return to my tick boxes at a later stage.
it means you need to work on your conversation skills, trying to prove that one should be prioritize more than the other won't do you any good if the other person (don't buy it). a high end honda has way more features than an old porsche but people will still buy the porsche;
You situation is more about making understand and feel which one is the right path
Why can’t you do both at the same time? Start up the campaigns, collect a small sample size, and then make ux changes. Track the numbers and show your father why it’s important to a/b test and improve user experience. 
TLDR: It still works, but I would recommend going with safer methods. 
If you have any specific questions, just let me know.

Where I live I would need college to get top mgmt position. 
Hi again, having hired apprentices in related areas (similar in that it's desk-based work in typical functions in corporations), I think there are two answers.  The known and the unknown.
It concerns me that in 5-10 years when you're looking for your first proper managerial role (no longer just a lead or a "senior", now someone who's responsible and accountable for getting shit done), the degree becomes more likely to make a difference.  Equally, if you're young and get designs on big-company director roles, the usual MBA route to them presumably means an undergraduate degree is already under your belt.
Who knows how the industry and perceptions will change in the next 10 years, but I think that's a risk.
In some companies it doesn’t- they want more skill or experience. In some it does. My boss only hires people with degrees. He thinks if they can get through school they can work hard. His daughter dropped out of college so he’s biased 
Dont stop with just seo or ads. The ultimate aim is to grow business. Seo or ads does not grow business. We need to create funnels for the growth of business. Learn and implement marketing funnels by also applying above given strategies. You can refer infusionsoft blogs, or read Russel Brunsens expertsecrets ebook n all. N atlast never stops learning. Keep upto date with the latest trends in digital marketing. 
lol, i also want to know that
Pages don’t have their own newsfeeds anymore. You now interact with the newsfeed using your personal account (or whatever Facebook account you’re using to access and manage the business account). 
I use 851 px by 360 px. The viewing dimensions are 851 pixels wide and 315 px tall for desktop, 640 px wide by 360 px tall for mobile so my dimensions cover both views. Make sure your text/graphics are in the center as to not get cut off in either view. 
and yes facebook drops down the quality when I do 851x315 the result looks bad, to be honest. Also, try to adapt the cover for mobile and desktop by doing a design that matches them both. Another thing, always try and play around with the resolution and everything to get a better idea.
This is the most common question especially asked by digital marketing freshers. First you need to know that increasing domain authority is differ at various level. In other words, it is easy to increase domain authority from 10 to 15. But it is very hard to increase domain authority from 50 to 55. 
We just started using a tool called Freedcamp. 
It’s got a few different ways of managing tasks/projects, has awesome team/user access management, has a CRM (pretty basic), password manager and most important to me for training purposes, a Wiki. 
You can have a totally different Wiki for each client/asset and another one for your internal processes. For example, I have Wikis for each client which detail posting topics/schedules and generally just client-specific stuff. I also have general onboarding documentation which is global throughout our business. 
The wiki is by far the most powerful feature of you work with VAs and at only about $7/month/user it’s very well priced just for that. 
At all stages, details are kept in the notes of the event - especially if work has been stopped and handed off. 
I don’t know how scalable my calendar system is but it certainly works. 😛
We use Asana and love it. Once I left basecamp, I never looked back.
If it's a set amount for the month I would still charge for the full month.
From my experience, most of those networks only provide junk traffic. 
They do but they are serving a lot of junk traffic
Get the Parter Program for each major platform (Google, Bing, Facebook etc). 
A good video can go a long way, something that quickly demonstrates your solution in a way that is friendly and to the point. I’d budget for FB and LI, test at a small scale and increase based on results. Make sure you are able to measure results to decide on future budgets.
I don’t know how much traction you will get with static ads, sometimes carousel ads will work well on FB. Especially with more sophisticated leads.
Look it’s going to cost you about $5CPM. You are looking at $1.00 to get a lead on the website. You are looking at conversion rate of 2.5% to 5%. Roughly $35 to $50 (because things go wrong and you constantly optimize) to acquire a customer. That’s pretty standard. 
You test content and make sure you are maintaining upstream performance and if that is working out then you try to fix downstream (website optimization, closing, etc).
There is no right or wrong answer, it really depends on the business. 
You need to "read the room" so to speak, and if your organic content doesn't resonate with your audience then I would pull it back. 
Some products/services are purchased frequently and do not require loyalty -- therefore, even if the user does not purchase the item this time, next time they are looking they will know their options.
Some products are hard to get for certain users -- like a home loan.
I read your post a couple times and it seems like there are a couple questions. And I am sure my response will upset a few purest so I will first way that there are many ways to reach a sale or the bottom of the funnel it isn’t always a straight drop from the top to the bottom. But let me provide some insight into your direct question and examples:
Think of the funnel as a highway not all of the traffic enters at the same place. Also funnels aren’t unique. So a customer may start at the top of company A’s funnel but make a purchase at company C’s site simply because it was the lowest cost available when they were ready to buy.
In both examples you show a reluctance to provide information. By doing so you are missing a very important opportunity. 
· If the company is high quality they will have a double opt in process and a unsubscribe button in their email to you.
· Providing this basic information allows you to evaluate this organization
In closing I would say the proverbial funnel works best for small business because it provided more personalize opportunities that big business can’t provide
Is Facebook marketplace available to you? 
I don't work in digital marketing but my dad owns an antique and collectibles shop in Singapore with its own Facebook page at 18K likes.
Figure out who your top 2 or 3 costumer profiles are and then figure out where those profiles spend their time and where they look when they're looking to buy. That's where you want to be.
I have experienced the same thing with funnels. Using video engagement for retargeting. We are still testing but the results don't look to good right now. Other people experience really great results with this though.
One of the largest months my company's every had
Also, I do retargeting but I only use the feed for the video. Retargeting I use multiple still ads and place them everywhere
Mixed results with video too. I've found even with good engagement on videos, retargeting is a bit hit and miss (especially if you use instream ads). But it's also difficult to measure brand awareness metrics of video and people Googling later on. 
First I'd think about who you're selling to. Is there a particular type of content they'd more likely to engage with? And why? Some audiences just don't respond to video. Other's (Millennials) love video. 
Think Problem -> trigger -> solution -> call to action. 
You might not really know without doing a split test (which you can do within Facebook) without overlapping audiences (but same demographic targeting) to test the type of content your audience engages with the most. 
Some dangerous kool-aid in my opinion. 
At least when I discovered it about 10 years ago. Wish I had the perspective I do now.
A lot of the threads are time wasters IMO, but there are some diamonds in there when you look. I have found out about certain tools early and new methods form this forum. There’s some good motivation now and then and it’s healthy to hear of different perspectives on certain subject matters.
There’s for sure a lot of wantrepreneurs and knuckleheads on there who come and go over time in fresh batches. And there’s scams and hustles that entrepreneurs themselves need to be aware of as to not fall victim, which is a plus of the forum that veteran entrepreneurs do not stand for this type of parasitic behavior and bullshitters will often get called out. 
I’ve never used the premium service and thus can’t say if it would provide any ROI to me. However it is always healthy to reverse engineer funnels and in this case I feel the revenue streams MJ DeMarco has created on his forum may offer some value to those who need / desire a private members club.
His first book was a quality read and I know he had success in the limo/private car lead generation business he created and sold multiple times, the second book however Unscripted was rather “ranty” and not really up there with his earlier work.
Definitely use UTM tags for all campaigns driving traffic to brand.com. Surprised you don't as an agency. FB metrics / analytics is pretty poor in isolation. 
I'm confused though, are you saying the rep told you that conversion attribution stops when the ad-set schedule has concluded? That's incorrect. 
Talk to your FB account manager, not FB Ad Support, they are almost always low level contractors so the level of support is pretty basic.
Treat them the way you treat your smaller clients. They're no different, they just have more money (hopefully!) :)
If you don’t know what you are doing and sold the product before even going into the meeting then you are useless.Gosh these millennials are all the same.
My best practice is to compress it until the image begins to visibly degrade then back it off a couple percentage points. Every image is going to be a little bit different. In the Photoshop Save For Web (Legacy) I usually start at about Quality: 65%. There are better compression tools out there, but this works for me as our emails are not image heavy. And yes, 600px max width is still the best. All my email templates are setup for 600px wide hero images and for most B2B comms I do 600x300px. 
Regarding image file size, I use the online resource tinypng.com and love it! Super easy to use - it often cuts my file sizes down loads of KBs or even MBs. Really helps with image load times!
When I hustled on the side, I used Upwork for several months to get client reviews and a few steady clients. Then I transitioned out of Upwork and was able to utilize my client testimonials to attract more work.  Good luck! 
Yeah bro. I feel the same.
I am working at a small firm and picking things on the go. 
If you deliver quality hits and they get their money worth you shouldnt underbid yourself. 
If you feel awkward asking for larger amounts of money push the fact you only do the low price as a favor. Just make up a reason why its a favor.
Excuse my English, not my native language. But I think I put my point across.
If they have an average RPM of $5-10, this means they'll earn $50.00 to $100.00 for every 10k page visits. This could be more or less if they have direct sells and other ways to monetize their posts.
Why not charge them on a cpc or cpm basis? If you're going the cpc way, then charge a slight premium over the cpc rates that fb typically charges advertisers. Premium because he's getting a very niche audience 
Share it on social media as well as bookmark it.
You can earn a profit after it gets ranked in Google for the particular keyword on first page. 
Seems like such a small niche to only go after hosting for digital marketers. Why not go after Wordpress only hosting....it’s worked well for companies like Flywheel. It’s really seamless. 
First, contact your former boss and say you need them to provide an account to transfer ownership. Say you need this within 5 working days (or 24 hours, however nice you're feeling!)
Email your former boss with the login information.
You already got great advice from the previous poster, but I just have to say that this is crazy. Your boss fired you and still left their public image (via social media) in a fired former employee’s hands?! I know there are lots of folks not versed in social media, but that’s ridiculous. He’s luck you aren’t a crazy person, op.
Cool.  I am subscribing. 
This is the type of thing that sounds great when an agency pitches it, but in reality consumers aren't following along, and unless you're creating tremendously entertaining content/providing major value, generally they don't really give a shit about your content at all.
I am a nobody in terms of influence, but on instagram I posted a comic book I wrote. I chopped it up into 40ish pieces, and sometimes people would go back and read the previous issues. I assume this multiplies with a larger audience.
I went to college for Marketing, then did a project for a company in my program which eventually landed me a job after I completed college. Now I'm 3+ years plus into the field. 
If your study has not been completed yet, you should finish first. What kind of work do you want to do? Is it online related or others?
Where are you located?  Do you have a college degree (in anything)?  
To expand on that, keep in mind that with nearly ALL search intent, the result is answering the question "What's in it for me?" - Your content needs to answer that fully. Use rich media (images, videos, charts, etc.) to help drive it home. 
Be real.
What you get paid per lead is way too low. Even I would pay you at least $20 per lead, and I don't even need these leads. Find a better way to monetize, because SEO is going to be a long journey.
SEO is a long-tail play so don't expect overnight traffic.
You can get a job in Hong Kong without the two years working experience, but need to prove they needed you over a local employee, so of they need Portuguese as a language requirement, you'd have quite the strong advantage. Most companies will only hire you though if you're already in HK, so recommend moving to HK with no job and finding one upon arrival.
You can also go to Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand the Philippines and get work there quite easily, or even work for youself as a digital nomad. You can work anywhere, really, as a digital nomad, but countries in SE Asia are super cheap to live in.
   * Try to learn more than the basics of Google Analytics, it is a very powerful tool that will give you a ton of insight into your business. Might want to consider using Google Tag Manager from the get-go. 
   * Learn a bit about UTMs for more in-depth tracking. 
* Use the data to understand your audience and their motivations and speak to those motivations. 
* Always be testing everything, try to derive ideas from data pulled from Google Analytics, hotjar, mouseflow, other analytics tools. Don't just *test* things for testing sake. Try to have a strategy based upon data -- most managers will need you to be able to explain why the idea will work. Data helps to solve that problem. 
* Develop a content strategy (make sure to do a keyword analysis and compete over keywords that you can realistically rank for first), optimize your content's SEO, and frame your content to try to move people into your funnel. Keep the content engaging, relevant, and unique. 
This is where I would start. 
Well a lot depends on what your current set up and goals are. Really there's no such thing as 'digital strategy' there's a marketing strategy that will incorporate online and offline in a consistant, coherent and cohesive way.
How will you use it and why? Maybe use a RACE framework to help identify what you could do where.
One of the great things about digital channels in comparison to offline is the measurability
The first answer has some excellent points on this so I won't add anymore.
Message me. I have a n'est way to take
Edit: Didn't really say why, the reason for this is because if a page is shown more often than another itll probably get more dowloads doesnt mean its better. I do analytics sort of at my work and when im collecting the stats we always work with conversions rates instead of numbers. 
Why does page (a) have a high conversion rate, where is that traffic coming from? What's happening on page and can you test some of those element on page (b) to boost conversion rates on that page? 
And conversely, why is page (b) getting the traffic and where is it coming from? What can you learn from that to try and improve page (a). 
Both important if you can learn from them. But to me the page with the traffic is the highest value (that's how a search engine would see it) and that's where I'd look to improve 
Typically, you want to look at the conversion rate (%). It’s tempting to take the page with 66% conversion as a better performing one but given the difference in numbers, that doesn’t appear to be objective.
Also, why one page gets more visits than the other?
Whatever you're talking about is nonsense without data. Get data then make an argument.
Are the 17 pages locations? 
\- Ability to help prevent cross over with audience segmenting
\- Wider placement i.e. audience network, pre-roll, etc
\- Frequency and Reach placement to determine and set how many times the same audience is seeing your ad
Great tool for exactly this!
Are there any free tools, any one used?
An example of when I used A/B testing was when each ad was advertising an offer at a different price. Didn’t want to run the risk of someone seeing both ads as they conflicted with one another. But if I was just testing content (eg different images), I wouldn’t bother A/B testing as I wanted people to see both ads to see which one they engaged with more.
After a few weeks, always replace your lowest performing ad and continuously A/B test. :)
I also stumbled upon Nightwatch recently and so far, so good :) I am on starter+ plan for $39 but they have regular starter plan for $19, too. Good luck
You could look into group buys, there are a few options out there that will give you access multiple applications for around the $20 figure. Some group buys are better then others though so you might have to test a few out.
It’s definitely digital marketing that you are doing, but it is very much generalised digital marketing - not necessarily a bad thing. I would imagine you are very busy but without the time to dig deeper into each marketing field? For example, I am a Marketing Manager for my company, but I specialise in social media - and, of course, I would have no time to do any other sort of digital marketing because it is a whole job in itself. 
In terms of looking elsewhere, you may want to become a specialist in a specific field of digital marketing that you enjoy doing? But if you want to stay in your current role, I would definitely suggest taking it up with your employers about your value to the company. It seems like you play a pivotal role! Hope this helps!
Talk to an experienced headhunter at least to get an outside perspective.  Try to find one that's been around at the same agency for a while who knows the market for marketers. A good one  can give some real insight. The trick is to find a real good one.
% of spend with a firm ROI target is my preferred method. With flat fee the incentive for the agency is to do just enough to keep the client while
Minimizing cost to the agency. % of spend with ROI target aligns incentives of the client and agency while giving both the incentive to scale the business profitably.
Flat fee... % imo creates a conflict of interest so we stay away from it.
nothing like hubspot academy honestly
That title though
- PPC and retargeted users from the landing page with display ads (best overall performance)
- A native ad that focused on the clients process and lead to a form fill landing page (had best ROI)
PM if you need any help
Set Google alerts for fire-related terms appearing in the news in the area that your client services. Then try and direct outreach to the people / businesses who come up in the news for fires.
- search competitor's website and know what they do that u are not doing. How is their website and business model better. Do alex ratings and see where ur company stands. Try create better sales funnel and see from there.
Goto an affiliate network and find some offers that you think you can deliver traffic to.  
PM me. I consult for Fortune 500s. Happy to help. 
I'm about 6 chapters in and it is really opening my eyes.
Find someone you know that has a small business and ask to run some Adwords campaigns for them for free.
Not sure if I missed it but are you marketing in Brazil? How do you know your competition is selling more? Maybe its a tough niche and they are struggling too? In general I'd say you need to optimize and market a little stronger. Like emails.. maybe your content isnt a strong enough sell to get people to pull out their credit cards. If you are determined to do this on your own try a email marketing course on Udemy? 
Likes and followers are great but that wont automatically trigger sales. I dont think there is any issues posting your product here, and if you are not comfortable thats okay, but it would help to see you in action. 
Lastly, in marketing we know that people dont just consistently buy - its a matter of posting at the right time. Maybe its back to school time and people are focused on other things for a little while. 
They don't know how to craft a headline that makes people act (click, sign up, register, install an app, etc), nonetheless how to do a simple split test. 
If you're freelancing, it can be hard to say no to money - I get that. But, the real opportunity is not in short term contracts, it's in getting hired as a marketer in an early stage company (no, it doesn't have to be a startup in SV) and getting the opportunity to purchase shares for a pre-money valuation. 
The only thing that separates "good marketers" from mediocre marketers is not really expertise or knowledge...
However, when it comes to marketing software and online courses, I know how to reach professionals and how to work with a sales team to convert prospects into customers. 
I would also gladly take a job in fashion e-commerce. 
It's using advertising platforms (most commonly Facebook, Google and LinkedIn), some form of communications tool (email or a messenger platform), optimizing communication on the website and making sure you talk to customers to find out their needs and pains. 
That's where the experience kicks in, and this takes time, effort, blood, sweat and tears to learn. 
It's almost never the salary that makes a marketer rich, it's the investments. 
Also, if you really want to stay a freelancer, try negotiating deals that pay you for each lead you bring in. 
That can help you make a lot of money. 
However, career wise, based on what i've seen there are 2 main directions. 1) do your own thing 2) work for an agency. The working for an agency, at entry level, likely means long hours and low to average pay. It should pay the bills but the real value there is working with some potentially big clients and just learning new things. If you jump in - have a plan. Maybe specialize in something down the road.
I've been freelancing for about 6 months now in this field part-time. Although it does not fully pay my bills yet I can definitely see when it will be very soon. Of course this way is more of a challenge, but I also didn't want to start at an agency because I knew after that I'd be too comfortable with it and probably never would've tried freelancing on my own, if that makes any sense lol.
Unfortunately not, that only works in Groups
Why specifically digital marketing though? I mean, why change industry in which you’re studying to work in?
Or do you just want quick and easy ways to make money online? 
Turn to social channels to find hottest ideas that is relevant and timely 
I know Spain is a much different market from where I am (the U.S.) but have you tried signing up small to mid sized clients for digital agency type work? 
I've had pretty good experiences with focusing on SEM but social and programmatic channels work well too. Keep your product offering simple and optimize the campaigns on nights/weekends when you're not at the office (make sure you don't do any side work during your regular job hours).
I run said digital marketing company in India is planning to find outsourced work from North America. This is too early in digital marketing, and the field is going to be very similar to IT. Which is to say teams comprising of managers and senior level people working in client facing roles in the US, and outsourcing execution part of the work to lower cost countries such as India. 
Arguments about people not able to work with and coordinate with offshore teams is off the mark. This is a just a teething issue of the industry, or is an issue at mid and lower sized companies. This is going to pan out pretty much like IT, if you want a frame of reference to think about it.
Also, I don't have too much experience with HR, but I don't see why that can't be outsourced either.  
Use twitter as a PR and announcement tool not just a content scheduling tool.
Other skills like Excel, CMS platforms like WordPress and Adobe Creative Suite go a long way and are very much needed day to day as a digital marketer.
If you do not have any product or service to sell through your website then no problem, just start writing blogs. Learn SEO from Moz and apply everything on your blogs. Try to rank them on SERP's and get some organic traffic.
Learn some social media marketing from SOCIAL MEDIA EXAMINER. Also, complete the inbound marketing course from hubspot to have a basic foundation of digital marketing.
When you have some good numbers in your Google analytics, show them to the interviewer. He/she will understand that you do not only have the theoretical knowledge from the courses but you have some experience as well. This will make you stand out in the crowd.
When I gave my first interview, I opened my analytics on my phone and showed the interviewers. I was hired in my first interview itself.
You're in the UK, so Google's Digital Garage is a great training, too, specific to Europe. I'm in the US and international shipping is a meh unless you are a large business, but in Europe, it makes more sense. Consider looking into it.
You really need to be given some work experience. 
Check out[ my other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/96lwf3/digital_marketing_what_do_i_need_to_learn_or_do/e41w9w3/?context=3), where I talk more in detail about this.
What the first guy said. I have a guide I send all my clients to either:
Make me an admin
Or to fix their Facebook name. 
Use a third-party tool to manage your account and create him a profile within said tool. 
Im really sorry as i have no room for my time. Try to google its quite easy step by step follow. 
It might sound pretty basic but we use analytics and can get a glimpse with the behavior flow and goal flow reports. Tracking campaigns accordingly allow us deeper insights into the customers' journey. Understanding their behavior within that, we use our in-house data and use good ol' excel. 
No there is no harm in using Wix. But being a digital marketer when you plan to do SEO for your website then you may face some problem. Because Wix doesn't allow to do any backend modification especially in coding area.
If you care about SEO then pick a wordpress theme with great reviews and support (look for fast loading and SEO friendly themes). Many of them are very customizable and super easy to install. You don't have to reinvent the wheel. I usually can deal with some design drawbacks, but cannot stand badly coded websites that break after each plugin install. Grab a decent hosting and you are all set! \~100 bucks a year for hosting, 30-100 for wp theme (one-time or annually). By putting some effort into content you can achieve great results online whatever they may be. Use youtube or reddit to find answers to questions that might come up. There are no coding skills required.
It's not a must, but you should have a website of your own.
They also have tons of tutorials and resources to help you learn it. 
Personally I studied on various online resources for free. Now I know a thing or two about advertising online and can manage ad campaigns on my own. 
You’d better write each letter from the start every time. You will spend much more time than using a template, but I promise you’ll get better results. 
An obvious one, but SEMrush. They have been adding so many more cool tools this past year to their platform.
What social media platforms are you advertising on?
Hey! I totally feel your struggle, it's hard to get work experience when most jobs or clients require a portfolio or some form of hands-on experience in the field. When looking for experience, I came across a really cool platform where you can do just that. I want to clarify that it is an unpaid position, however, it offers you [quantifiable digital marketing experience](https://genm.co/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=forum&utm_campaign=reddit3) and connects you with businesses who are looking for a bit of help for just 5 to 10 hours a week. You can start building your portfolio, see what you like best in the realm of digital marketing, and even get a testimonial from the business you work with for 3 months. 
Hope this helps!
Most agencies seem to charge an arm and a leg for their services. Tons of local businesses that can't afford that. Start with them and offer your service dirt cheap to get started 
Experiment with different tactics to get traffic, document them.
These things should help you land a job, it'll show not only do you know about these concepts, you've actually executed them with success. This will also help you figure out what types of channels you are most comfortable with and what you want to specialize in. 
To find paid work though, start with your immediate network, do you know anyone with a small business that hasn't started using digital marketing? Or has and hasn't seen results. Pitch to them, figure out how to help them and use their results in your portfolio on your website/blog.
Hey! I understand how that feels like. Personally it comes to 2 main skills learnability and adaptability. Rise in AI has definitely made a lot of impact in digital marketing and you can clearly check it out online. B2B marketing is trending in recent times and LinkedIn becoming the most famous choice for everyone. Its called programmatic marketing and LinkedIn is the best platform for it. You just need to have good connections and everything will fall in place. You can definitely check out my course on programmatic marketing which is the next thing in digital marketing https://www.udemy.com/share/100hMcAEoedFdXTXg=/. All the best mate!
Basic strategy I'd recommend is to write at least 1 in-depth article on both topics/keywords and make sure to include the keyword in the first 1-2 headlines and early in the first paragraph after the first headline.
After that, the next factors for search ranking are loading time (make sure so optimize images with TinyPNG or sth. similar), don't use more images than needed. Use a website speed checker like Google Pagespeed Insights to check what you could improve.
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:
- [/r/graphic_design] [Career moves after digital marketing account manager role at agency](https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/8lvra6/career_moves_after_digital_marketing_account/)
I would definitely recommend eClincher! I do a lot of creative stuff for clients, lots of content, images, etc. It has definitely made it a whole lot easier. I feel like its way easier to use compared to others like Hootsuite, but that's just me. 
Hmmm, I have used various like Buffer, Hootsuite, and like you mentioned, Facebook's own scheduler. I honestly just prefer to make a trello board. It is similar to the excel sheet you are using, but you can also collaborate  with others if in a team.

>Are there any ways I can generate targeted traffic organically, 'now'?
I have a new site also. I find Pinterest has been a pretty decent traffic driver, but honestly I'd love to hear other opinions as well. 
Need more time to get traffic. You should find a SEO company.
Spend time on different platforms. Reddit is great, but check out Pinterest and IG as well. If you have time, use Twitter and FB too. Every place you post is another audience you can get to. 
There are many things to cover since content marketing and digital marketing are quite vast spheres. You can go through our blogs [here ](http://oddrepublic.com/Home/blog)on these topics and see what fits your needs best, or send me a message with the specifics and I would be glad to answer your questions!
VPN Subscriptions Doubled Following the FCC’s Net Neutrality Repeal. Does this affect display ad targeting? If so how?
I’m in the U.K. but my answers shouldn’t be too dissimilar. 
~Firstly sign the paper work~
For me this is normally an NDA (non disclosure agreement) and a contract. You might think an NDA is OTT but if you’re about to reduce pricing or launch a new product you’d want to keep it private until it lands. 
A contract is key as at the end of the day you’re paying for a service and they need to agree to a set of deliverables which defines the service e.g 2 posts, 1 story, 1 tweet...
List everything that you expect and the timescales. Only with this you can then say they provided their service or they didn’t. They should also have some agreements on their side to define payment methods and invoice times, stop thinking of it as a person on social and instead a business, this is b2b and you’re paying a business or brand for a service. 
It’s all fair and well paying someone for their audience but what you want to be doing is taking their traffic and making it yours! 
Keep me updated
Marketing and computer science
Most people in digital marketing that I know or are in my networks, went to college for a completely different field. Marketing in most colleges is more in the traditional sense, which can be somewhat helpful but will nowhere near prepare you for digital marketing. Communications and computer science will help a bit, I went to school for both. 
Just major in Business and learn everything you need to know about marketing from Google University, YouTube videos, marketing books, and real experience.
Screw college bro, this is way better https://indemandcareer.com/idc-new-sales-webcam/
Google offers training and certification for free.
What would you consider an expert? I know I'm by no means one haha. I'm 19 and currently work as an assistant for an agency remotely but have a private client as well. Would a digital marketing expert be knowledgeable in every field? SEO/PPC and on various platforms? I agree with you though, I definitely don't call myself an expert but I see many who know even less than me and talk themselves up to get easy money with clients who don't know better.
Regulation? Not possible. What every human needs to do is pay attention to actions, ignore words. 
In politics, in sales and marketing, in every aspect of our lives: filter out verbiage. It's empty air and meaningless. Only actions speak truth.
I've seen this particular situation before. One of the issues I've noticed from experience for example is that a company poured a tone of money into lead generation/advertising but their strategy and ad campaigns were in need of serious improvement. For example do you do A/B testing on your ads. Do you use google Analytics event tracking/tag manager to try and figure out what people are doing on your website at the microscopic level. Have your written an E-book that you offer to people if they sign up to your newsletter. Do you hold home improvement webinars. Then after you do all these things do you try and measure the results. Essentially what I'm trying to say is from experience I've seen companies spend quite a bit of money on lead generation without actually measuring that process and analyzing the hell out of it. PM me if you have more specific questions.
I think a better question is why aren't these many channels providing you leads? Maybe look at your current campaigns, or have an expert provide an audit, and work on what you already have going, instead of trying to stretch your marketing efforts further. 
I've worked a lot in this vertical over the years and here are a few things that work well for me in property/construction 
Remarketing with FB lead gen ads
It's hard to know where you are - 7 years experience doesn't necessarily mean anything given the speed at which things change, and how slow some people are to develop skills.

You might want to improve your analysis skills. I recommend the Simplilearn's advanced web analytics course. The instructor is Avinash Kaushik, one of the most renowned professionals out there.
Freelancing is hard for digital marketers unless you have some good experience or knowledge under your belt. I for one, work at an agency and have only dabbled in to freelance as it is very competitive.
Freelance digital marketing has opportunities, but I would say the SEO part of digital marketing gets the most freelance work. On many freelancing platforms you will notice that there are lots of SEO freelance work, so I would start with SEO and then SEM, and though it is competitive, focusing on a niche will help you succeed. What do you mean by platform? Do you mean the digital marketing platform?
Getresponce for my autoresponder
Clickmagick for my tracking
3) They have different different policies so you need to research on it.
Let me know if you want more details.
Just keep in mind that this is not an easy field to break into, especially on a freelance level. It will take considerable hard work and patience to start seeing growth and profits you can live on. 
I use social media, SEO and PPC for digital marketing. 
3.    What is the average profit and is it worth the hours to put in? (Obviously, market something that people want and need)
I have transitioned from a design background, now head of a digital agency.
Best place to start is your existing clients. Build out some campaigns , try and get better results every month (use good results to argue for more budget 😎😎😎 ) - go from there.
You can do it with any background man I was a union carpenter at 21 and now I'm 27 and a CMO with 6% profit share of a digital marketing company that generates over half a million a month. I have no college degree I taught myself one thing at a time. Knowing html and css helps same as navigating a server back end but the best skill to have is learning new skills and also very important is working very quickly, so automation and outsourcing solutions should also be at the forefront of your mind. Also takes a lot of time man I mean you really have to be interested by your work or you just simply won't do it enough, not many people have that last trait and trust me it's the make or break factor in this industry
Both Facebook and email marketing are great tools. Besides these two, you can leverage other social media channels like Instagram and Pinterest. Both of these are amazing to promote your clothing business. 
Running giveaways on Instagram will increase your brand awareness and grow your community’s size. Make sure every email subscriber follows you on Instagram. Remember customers’ birthdays and send a coupon with your birthday wishes to build your brand loyalty. 
AdWords can work too, but keep an eye on negative keywords and try to avoid relying on broad match keywords. 
The major digital platforms have really great training available for free online (Google Academy for Ads, Facebook Blueprint). It won’t fill in the basic marketing fundamentals (basic understanding of messaging, positioning, targeting, media & creative) but it will teach you the tools for free (and I like the training directly from them over probably 20 different paid programs I’ve seen over the years—they can’t keep up with the constant changes to the platforms like FB and Google themselves). 
I learned a ton by helping out some non-profits with their websites and some basic marketing. Learn Google Analytics for starters, get it implemented on their site if it isn’t already and tag up some activity (they probably have email campaigns they aren’t tracking properly or robustly). As you get better at analyzing and understanding site traffic, it will help you to understand the right traffic you want to go after—then it’s time to experiment with some paid Facebook and/or search or GDN. So many great causes out there and they’ll almost never turn down free marketing help.
What platforms have you learned? 
I'm late to this thread, but I was in a very similar boat. First of all, it's NEVER too late. I made a very similar shift when I was 28. I was stuck in a sales career path that looked like it had no end in sight, and I wanted to get out. The only thing I had that was definitively marketing related experience, was my Bachelors degree in Marketing. Other than that, all of my work experience was in sales.
How I got out was I began focusing on getting more marketing credentials. I got certified in Hubspot, but also Google Analytics and Google Adwords. I put those credentials on my LinkedIn profile and certainly highlighted them on my resume. Also, don't discredit your current work experience. As an insurance agent you probably understand the fundamentals of sales, the sales funnel, and how consumer think and make decisions.  This is invaluable in digital marketing because those skills show you understand people's buying behavior.  I'd reflect that on your resume as well.
Finally, the biggest step is getting in the door to marketing and scoring interviews. After countless failed attempts at the traditional application process of applying to positions online. I decided to go rogue. I used my sales techniques to find C-level email addresses for all of the agencies in town. I then wrote each one a personalized email with an outrageous Email Subject Line that was impossible to ignore. Then in the email I quickly call the reader out for opening my email, and in a modest and funny way boast about how I can get people's attention which is the first step in marketing. This email that went out to 20 or so agencies, landed me 3 interviews. From there I was able to score a position as Business Development and Management for a digital marketing agency's video production studio. Not my ideal position, but it got my foot in the door. From there I quickly started making connections and bothered nearly every "digital marketer" in the office to give me pointers and let me help them with projects. Since then, I moved on to be an Account Manager and strategist for another agency across the street.
TLDR; Get certifications, Leverage and interpret your current work experience as marketing experience, and get creative when reaching out for job interviews. Also, get your foot int he door and make quick connections.
I was Freelancing for two years and doing my own projects and testing on the side as well as continuing education. Now I work at a Full-Service agency. Good Luck!
I've been learning by doing. My first client took a chance on me, and now I just got my 3rd client. You likely know more than I do...
Hubspot academy, Google certifications/academy and Udemy. Udemy has a lot of Sales, so sign up for their emails and wait for a class you want to cost around $10 instead of the posted multi hundred-dollar price tag.
Personally, I attended an MSc last year. Great sources are Google's and Hubspot's online courses - as mentioned above - which are free. There is one called Digital Garage by Google that might be helpful too. 
Udemy is a very good place to learn better and faster. It has also a lot of free tutorials. Lynda has excellent tutorials too. I agree with you about YouTube tutorials (it's too hard to find a good tutorial). 
I used to work at a media agency in London so did a lot of courses courtesy of the IPA (Institute of Practitioners in Advertising) 
Without Practically SEO is nothing...
In Digital Marketing Course, you'll learn how to grow your business with social media marketing, search engine optimization (SEO), content marketing, email marketing, pay-per-click (PPC) and additional and the way to convert the incoming traffic into paying customers.
Before the finish of the course, you'll have defined your audience, set up a website and driving traffic to the major marketing channels.
Also want to know something about the work culture in DM.  
There are so many moving parts. That it is easy to slip up. Eg, running over budget, making a small error with huge consequences like in a UTM code... 
It's keeping track of everything effectively. I work for a small start-up, I'm the sole marketer, but once you find a rhythm it gets easier. But getting to that part when starting fresh is always a bit of a challenge. 
Digital Marketing is here to stay as traditional marketing becomes more a thing of the past. I think the best way to learn is to dive right into it, there is no right or wrong approach it is more about being able to "self-teach". I found this guide to be really helpful: https://jumpseller.com/learn/how-to-sell-online/ You can find good courses on platforms like udemy. Hope it helped!
anyone that is preaching about income growth 
its worth listening to #garyvee , but take into account he was moderately privileged more than most.
I want to see their critical thinking ability here. There are too many times when a candidate has these great big ideas but they are not thinking deep enough to flesh it out. Who are they targetting in these emails? Are they thinking about the customer journey and marketing funnel? How are they incorporating the strategy into other marketing channels to amplify the campaign? Are they creating a custom landing page for the campaigns to increase conversion? How will they measure KPIs after the campaign? I am also extremely data-driven so I look for candidates that create strategies with that in mind. Marketing isn't always about ROI but it's good to know they think about it as your clients care about that.
Don't go too hard on them! 
Depends what the client profile is like and what the position is. Just general Digital marketing?
Why not have a conversation with them, asking them questions like, "how they approach digital strategy in general"? While their answer might not be right on target, it will at least reveal their thought process to a certain extent.
The worst candidate would say something like “X set it up so I don’t know”
An OK candidate would probably note that they use different tracking codes
If the candidate goes as far as explaining the restrictions (whether business or technical) of FB/AdWords conversions and how they have tackled or would want to tackle it... then you’ve got a winner.
For more mid-level positions you could ask about reporting strategies. How might they show CLIENTS the value that the agency brought them. For this, a lead gen + b2b client with a long sales cycle is a good choice. There aren't always easily attributable conversions to reference. Seeing how a candidate fumbles with answers on the fly can indicate how they'll interact with clients under pressure. 
Some will suggest tests like "create a mock campaign" but with what tool? And what dummy website? or what dummy list? - areb you going to somehow create fake traffic to test performance? Are you going to provide a budget for your fake ppc campaign? lol
To create a simulation excercise will be entirely too much work for you to even create a suitable environment to test and analyze. Digital marketing is not like a  graphic design or dev role where you can assign a project and expect to see results.
This way you'll get an understanding of their thought process, their approach to leveraging various marketing tools, and have a clearer understanding of their competence in my opinion. 
A test?! I've hired a lot of people now, and I've never given them a test. I do have a matrix of questions I'll ask - categorized by things like "Cultural Fit", "Leadership", "General Technical", as well as skillset questions categorized by "Email Marketing" etc.
3. Draw a funnel on the whiteboard showing 10,000 visitors, 500 leads, 50 opportunities, and 10 new customers (or any other numbers you think are interesting). Now have the candidate pretend they're the CMO for the company, and they have to decide what the marketing team should do to improve their marketing. (Push to pick one part of the funnel. Looking to see how the candidate thinks about the funnel, if they have an intuitive sense of what good and bad conversion rates are, and if they understand how the funnel steps are connected. You also want to see if they understand which different tactics you can use at each step to improve that particular step.)
You're welcome, I think these platforms take patience and tenacity :)
As for getting clients there are many strategies. Mine was as bog simple as it gets. I went cold calling in person to businesses. Once I got a few, they gave me local referrals, then I started having clients come to me from all over.
Never be afraid to reach out to people, worst that can happen is that they say no or ignore you.
Needless to say, pretty much the only thing you’ll be able to do for the time being is track how much traffic you’re sending to the listing and if there’s any lift in your sales MoM. 
Filmora for video editing
Square for payment processing
I'm from Slovakia, which is one of the countries where this new "explore feed" is in beta stage. I can confirm that organic engagement dropped drastically for our clients and also sales from facebook.
Didn’t the Explore feed got cancelled?
sprout social has a much better UI
May I invite you to checkout our product [RecurPost](https://recurpost.com). We are almost one year old (started Aug 2016) and have close to 10,000 active users. 
We not only allow you to post as per your schedule, we specialize in recurring scheduling. You categorize your updates into various libraries (my blogs, other people's content etc.) and then set a schedule for that library. Once an update has gone out, it will sit and wait at the end of the library to be posted again once everything else has been posted.
Looking for something new also to use for multiple clients. Can’t seem to find anything that will do all the platforms I need (Facebook, Twitter, instagram, google plus, linked in, Pinterest). I don’t mind paying for what I’m getting just can’t find anything that has it all...
Looking for a new option too. 
I use Buffer, which has a free version. But their paid version has a few solid upgrades and it isn't that expensive.
Start slow, build the site before buying the ads.  Set up Google Analytics next to make sure you know the traffic and ad attribution from the beginning.  Set up a few ads initially from one or two channels (Google, FB) at low volumes and see how they work.  Get lots of data and show them you are working.  Get comfortable building them reports in Excel and every time you decide to change/grow build off of success every time.  Document it all, keep records.  Stay on top of ROI.  
1. Consumer profiles? Sounds nice, but just ask the owners about their current customers. They know who comes to the store.
2. Social media marketing report? This comes later. Get the social media avenues up and running. Make them matter, or don't bother. 
4. SEO for Wordpress? Yoast is the place to go. https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/ 
5. You're talking about paid search. You can set up a geographic radius on your ads, so only people within two miles see your ads (or 30 miles if you're in a rural place).
6. The exams are great, but it's the knowledge behind it you're looking for. Give yourself some time. Make some mistakes. Share the mistakes with the owners so they know what not to repeat in the future. And good luck.
7. Impressions and engagements are nice. They are easily measured. But ultimately they don't matter. Sales matter. All the impressions in the world don't matter if they don't drive sales now and in the future.
4) 100% get Google Analytics set up. The most valuable tool for any digital marketer
1) Right now I'm developing 2-3 consumer profiles w/ demographics and psychographic information ... I have 200-300 customer emails. If I upload that, can FB help me develop profiles based on previous customers?
5) One of our objectives is that when someone Google searches our keyword, that people within our geographic targeting, see our ad and click on it site and end up calling. To accurately measure, I should get the company to invest in a phone # just for the Google Ad?
Social media (Facebook /YouTube pages)
Then start to think about other sources of inbound traffic such as Facebook ads, display ads in local media etc. 
Follow certain blogs or Twitter handles like:
Guys, please, help me to boost social media sharing activity on my blog. I am boosting marketing and I’ve got a decent budget for it, still the sharing statistics are quite pessimistic. How do I attract more people to share the content from my blog page to users social media profiles? 
Coschedule - mainly social media scheduling but good content
When you say Adwords certification, is that in all of categories? I think the obvious step is to have all of those certifications (I believe to even get the initial certification you need one of those five. I have it in display.)
Can't say it's certification but there's a need for programmatic training. It's the next logical step in being a well versed digital advertiser.
If you google it you can find it, but you need to put in a custom code element into page and put the code in like you  would the back end of a site. 
Btw, i've thinking to this myself. :D
It depends on what your goals are, who you are targeting, etc - rather than platform. At least in my opinion, I was in this same dilemma sometime ago and began to use a tool that helped me better track such predictions that I have with regards to each. Give FOCUUS - a performance marketing & tracking platform - a try. It'll provide you answers to these questions. It's free so it cannot really hurt for testing. Best of luck!
CPM Pricing model is mostly used for branding and direct sales. 
Most struggle for a long, long time. There's a few reasons for that but the main thing is - why you? Why should they answer you? They have marketers contacting them a few times a week, so you're going to need to stand out.  
I'm fascinated by Steven Holen, the world's leading expert on what Mastodon bones look like when broken by humans or naturally. Yes, really. He has an expertise That precise. That's why you need to do.  
God. I landed my first client after 1 month of relaunching our company. Thought I "made it," getting paid $125k base with possible bonuses for increasing the revenue and private valuation. Then uncovered fraud after my first month there and got terminated for it. 
Marketing is a spec (speculative & specification) business which requires months of prospecting, building relationships, and PUTTING CONTENT out about your approach, beliefs, work, and so forth. That was my biggest mistake. Shying away from social media for and about yourself is the worst way to build a business.
How do you generally go about trying to get clients?
Yes this will affect your QS. Google reads text in the HTML to understand your page. If it can't read the text your score will suffer. 
Here is a datasheet which is self-explanatory & shall guide you to be, as you say “AN EXEMPLARY DIGITAL MARKETER”.
Scott was ahead of his time. Lots of others out there but this book really helped me wrap my head around digital marketing and social media.
I don't think it's over saturated, if you're good. Their are lots of cheap companies that don't bring results. I think that you need to provide a really good service, though. Just making some generic social media posts doesn't cut it anymore. Really valuable and entertaining video content or articles still work. SEM and SEO still matter. Apps, too. User interface and experience is more important now than ever. 
The big bucks are in UI/UX and SEM. 
Hope that helps!
Marketing as a whole is saturated. If you want something new and scarce, study something else. If the prospect of having to compete with a few hundred other applicants for an entry level job scares you, you should definitely not switch.
Either way, though it's cliche, I truly believe in T shaped marketers. You need to have a basic understanding of every digital marketing (and preferably the traditional ones too) specialization, to understand how they fit together, and then pick one or two that you are most fit for to go deep on. Which ones? You won't know until you've tried them. What have you tried, what do you enjoy doing so far?
Like others in this thread, I don't think the profession is over saturated with GOOD people. It is, however, oversaturated with mediocrity.
The great thing about digital marketing is that it's applicable in every industry. As time goes on, more people will find themselves online for more time during the day. 
It's not too saturated - not at all. In my local area, about 20% of businesses actually use social media in a strategic way. About 5% actually use digital marketing and paid ads in a strategic way. Most businesses today got their start by relying on word of mouth and SEO, and this is STILL WHERE THEIR TRAFFIC COMES FROM in most cases. 
I originally started with SEO, then realized through trial and error that specializing in Facebook ads is extremely useful because of the current landscape / capabilities of Facebook. 
Google Adwords is a free course that offers study guides and quizzes online. Not to mention that it's highly reputable in the digital marketing field. 
Being a digital marketer makes you cutting edge to what is now passe in the marketing field.. like display ads for programmatic campaigns and native ads versus the old school spammy ones. I write about new ways to target customers in my blog. I hope it's helpful to anyone who checks it out. 
Digital Marketing is now becoming mainstream so it has become clear to 90% of businesses that they need to do it in order to survive. This has left a huge opportunity for people in the industry to capitalize. Even traditional marketing companies are having to adapt. 
I am currently enrolled in a digital marketing course, and my professor has his own digital marketing consulting firm-- a successful one, at that.  He makes it seem like not only is it possible to have a career in digital marketing, but that it's an easy field to have your own business in.  He said it's a field that keeps growing and growing, so I would assume that the job market in digital marketing is pretty good. 
As far as specializations go, I would say start our with SEO, but have a lot of knowledge in other areas.  Becoming Adwords certified is always a plus and can help you stand out from others when applying to internships, jobs, etc. I recently finished my Adwords certification, and I'm really happy I did.
I'm in the process of writing a blog that I'm hoping will help college students and other beginners in the field to become more familiar with marketing topics. It's in its beginning stages right now and needs a little work, but let me know if it's something you'd be interested in reading!
Also does your firm have a content strategy for inbound? Then the prospects can find free value from you which your competitors might not be. Depending on the location of you, your prospects, and competitor, you may be able to play the local card.
$999 is such a ridic amount of money.
Either your expectation management is not good, or your screening of clients is lacking. Considering your other post, she seems to be randomly demanding results. Either way, look into the growth hacking sites to find tactics for driving email signups fast. If you're starting from zero it'll be probably be specific landing pages with adwords runnning against them. 2 weeks probably won't cut it to get a sizeable list, but at least you'll have systems in place that will work towards that goal.
You could run a webinar.
Promote the webinar via paid social (fb/linked in probably) linking to a registration form & landing page. 
Edit: also, potentially push back on the timeframe. If the client wants a decent list from scratch without paying then in my experience this will take longer than a few weeks.
You could also do about paid promotion via someone else's list/site.
I've made lists of thousands of emails the...old fashioned? way. For example, I was prospecting once (horrible demographic, but good example) Ned & Breakfasts; in PA, NJ, DC, and NYC. So I googled, "bed and breakfast, Pa." then opened every Link, scouted websites, took basic notes, and put email address with info in excel.
Both. But career opportunity wise, more companies need their SEO and SEM in order than they need their social media up to snuff.
You can Google online gif Creator. There are many that do it for free. Here's one: http://gifcreator.me.
The only way to make it is to add value to a company either as an employee or contractor/consultant. If you came from a relatively unrelated industry or focus you have to demonstrate what transferable skills you have.
Focus on the client's need over your own and go balls to the wall in pitching your services. Never stop. The new world of marketing is fast paced, and only the strong survive. Be on LinkedIn, go to networking events, and always believe you're the best for the job.
My experience with Wix has been that it is very difficult to get thorough conversion tracking set up. 
I tried a bunch of e-marketing and e-commerce stores, nothing worked the only thing I benefited from was analytics. I'll tell you what I tell everyone who wants to explore E-commerce. Open a Shopify/Woocommerce account, and sell something online. To be honest that's the only way you will learn is by trying. Shopify, have a vast amount of knowledge about e-commerce. They cover everything from photography, to copywriting, and marketing. Good luck.
You've proven that these efforts drive value so maybe you can hire a partner? 
Hope this helps!
*What may be a good idea is to turn up to the interview and leave them will a tiny 'portfolio' of something you could do for them if you were to be hired. For example, 'I've written a blog and a few social media posts if you would like to have a look at them' and take a couple of copies. If you want to really impress them with analytics that probably no other candidate would then I would happily help you get started and point you in the direction of worthwhile blogs you can read - feel free to message me. 
There's an algorithm in place by Facebook that recognizes the customers conclusion by means of some variation of "thanks". Sometimes a little Facebook message will pop-up and ask if their response was a conclusion in which you can click "yes/no". That Facebook message doesn't always pop-up, but it will typically always recognize the "thank you" variation. They probably just use the confirmation question to confirm different responses. 
I don't think I've ever been sold to so hard. Neil Patel can sell on 20 levels at once.
Though the bookish knowledge is not going to help you much in Digital Marketing, but to build strong basics, this is my favorite list of Digital Marketing Books:
The more I stay in it, the more jaded I feel from the daily onslaught of fake news, stupidity and spam corroding social media, but examples like this remind me why I got into social marketing in the first place. Such a cool "case study" and unique usage for the platform. Glad you got Ernie back!
Maybe you need to outsource to somebody to do a worse job than you do!!! How much do you want to pay me to be average!!!
Doing a  comp or offer via fb would increase conversion. But maybe not the traffic you want
Need more info on the click rates of the ads.  How many people are clicking but not converting into a sign up?  If the ads are getting clicks, but not converting into signups, you will need to adjust something on the sign up form.  Its either turning people off once they arrive, too difficult to sign up, not enough incentive to sign up, etc.
Doing a  comp or offer via fb would increase conversion. But maybe not the traffic you want
Try using the Facebook lead ads form 
Ok, so there are a ton of platforms out there that do this kind of stuff. It really comes down to the type of analytics you want and if you want to use the platform for content management and engagement as well as analytics. Team structure is also important. Is it just you or do you want to have other people have access to the system?
If you just want to track followers, which is kind of meaningless BTW, you are probably better off just building an excel sheet and manually inputing the data on a regular interval. 
Sysomos is probably my favorite, but it can be expensive. I love them as a tool for doing market analysis. They are just overkill for my current needs. 
If you just want to track follower growth, you can just use socialblade.. dunno if they have fbook in it yet but has all the others. 
Crowdbabble is working on YouTube analytics now and they won't be ready until spring, so I can't help you there. It does have the other three plus LinkedIn.
If you only want to track that one metric, I might suggest just doing it manually. Seems crazy to pay a monthly fee that includes hundreds of metrics if you just want the one.
We did a huge review process of these. Engagor and TrackMaven are great but also on the pricier side and do a lot more than follower growth. Much more basic is True Social Metrics which is also great in its own right. 
Your Dad simply does not know what he's talking about (with all due respect), but thats okay. When I try explaining my position (Paid Social Media Specialist) to my 60 yr old parents, they don't quite 'get it' either - but the reality is, the working world they once knew no longer exists. 
You don't need to build your "personal brand" to work in this industry. Just build your resume like the rest of us. And enjoy knowing that while many industries are dying, digital marketing has only just arrived. 
I understand where you're coming from, I graduated in 2011 with my bachelors degree from a well-respected school, it took me until this September 2016 before I found a well-paying job in digital marketing sales at an ad tech company. Before that I worked in finance, not at all my field, or a position that I wanted to be in. I live in Rochester, NY, so not exactly the advertising capital of the world. Every marketing/ad agency here wanted 5 years of agency experience, and there were 100+ applicants to 1 open position. It wasn't until I went back to school and was able to put a Masters in Marketing (in-progress) on my resume, that i finally got a foot in the door. Depending on where you live, it definitely was not easy for me. 
How much work experience do you have? 
If the media buy if over 100k, dm me.
Here is my two cents:
Why? Because I love RPGs. I was 7 when FF7 came out and I haven't looked back since then. 
I have worked as a Digital Marketing (DM) intern for a startup. I used to crank an average of 8-9 hrs daily and this excludes time I spent learning stuff on my own. 
I don't believe DM particularly offers a work-life balance but you do get firms that offer a work environment that encourages work-life balance. The startup I worked for did that. 
However, if you have desirable skills, mostly technical, you can have a solid career and demand much more with respect to work life balance. 
The work life balance sucks for those who:
At least this has been my experience. Just as an n=1 statement, I used to work with this gentleman who was a very competent front end developer but also knew SQL and digital KPIs / metrics inside and out. He never complained about work life balance. 
The more valuable you make yourself, the less you have to work at being replaced...until you get to the strategic level (C-suite seat at the table stuff). Then, you're baked into the system, and you also become very expensive and difficult to replace.
Measurefest is coming up in November (www.measurefest.com). It's a CRO and analytics event, £150 a ticket and put on by the Brighton SEO guys (another event, thta I'd definitely recommend - FoC and only an hour from London each April and September). 
This is the most ridiculous sales pitch I've seen in a long time. 
If it was easy everyone would do it and hiring experts as a startup with nothing more than an idea is so unbelievably wasteful. 
Ideas are everywhere and worthless without implementation. 
If there is a way to remove the "no thanks just let me view" button this would be a nice viable tool.
Do they have an individuals pricing option available?
Is it worth it for career development? I don't think so. Interview is king, to bastardise a phrase.
I'll also mention that I did test the sitemap using GSC and the test found no errors.
As for me, it is a successful “all-in-one” combination of Prestashop, Magento and WooCommerce. Let me explain why. Usually it is very costly to buy 3rd party software. So, I have found eCommerce solution which is able to develop extensions by itself. 
Besides, I am extremely concerned about security and reliable hosting was my prerogative. SCE provided me with Hypersonic CDN which boosts the speed and protects my data. I like all-inclusive offers. Check these features if so do you.
I enjoyed your post and agree with all except one point; Not paying influencers. As a blog author and social media influencer I deserve to be compensated for my work and for the audience I’ve worked so hard to established just as everyone else deserves to be compensated for the honest, quality work they produce.
I am sceptical of this information. The sample size is reported at 1,907 adults which seems small to me. 
Globally there is a trend of an increase of 16,000,000 members per quarter. If we follow the trend that 30% of those new monthly members are from the United States due to the previous precedent of growth since Q1 2011.
From these statistics it could be concluded that LinkedIn is in fact continuing to grow at a stable rate in North America. 
I'm probably missing something though as I am only a lowly Marketing apprentice and am getting my information from [Statista.](http://www.statista.com/statistics/274050/quarterly-numbers-of-linkedin-members/)  
Go on?
The downside I see to this is people's fear of being stalked. At a conference I was lead on, I had personalized calendars made for all the attendees where their name appeared on the photo of every month. Some of the attendees thought it was kind of stalky (but a cool piece of swag), like how could we know all the attendees. I got the attendee list names because my company was a gold sponsor and that was one of the perks.
You can prepare and take the certification test for the Google Analytics individual qualification here: http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/index.html (the test used to cost $90 but now I believe it is free)
For Adwords, this /partners response has a lot of the need to know info: https://support.google.com/partners/answer/3153810?hl=en
SEMRush and Search Console, although neither will help much if the site doesnt rank for anything.
What is the content? Video, image, blog, social post?
SEMrush has a plagiarism checker with their SEO Writing Assistant tool.
Contact Support via your Ads Manager. They much more likely to help people that spend money on their platform, sadly. They're almost always helpful, and if they can't be they will get someone to email that will be able to help.
I worked out a way to do a complete name change. Rather not post it publicly so PM me and I'll tell you what I did.
I don’t know for sure, but I think when you have more than 2000 fans (or something) you actually need to contact the Facebook support.
I help agencies/businesses who want to outsource their link building, here are my tips on how to build backlinks:  
What other questions about SEO /link building did you have?
If you have a limited budget, then you should start building backlinks on high-authority sites. What do I mean by that? Profile links, web 2.0's, social bookmarks, article submissions, etc.
The basic backlinks are your local business directories, but these have its limits.
Another way to do it is to ask for a guest post on a popular blog with high DA. But they will most likely say to cough up expensive money.
So the best way is to actually buy links of high TF 15-25+. But I would avoid fiverr and all these marketplaces because they really do not work
PM me and I can provide you with these if you wish
Hope that helps!
I’ve been drinking, but no.
Yes easy to tweak for cheap CPMs but who cares if those aren’t converting 😌😌😌 it’s about creative, ROAS, scale, car, etc so again, drinking but no
Just showing CPM is REALLY fishy. Generally, to reach more apt customers you have to spend more. My guess is they're blasting their ads worldwide with little to no regard for who's seeing it, which drives the CPM down, but will definitely also lead to terrible other KPIs.
Super opaque and red flags shooting up for me. Proceed with caution, or better, don’t proceed.
Yeah umm, no. 
4. Use your money and put it towards fb/ ig ads. 
6. Experiment a lot and test on what marketing campaigns are worth it
Dont do it. They are phishing for free advice. Give them enough information to prove you know what to do but dont tell them specifically. They likely are doing this to dozens of "prospects" with no intention to hire them. I have been through this before, essentially providing thousands of dollars worth of information for nothing. Offer to do an evaluation and create a marketing plan as a consultant but dont do it for free.
Experience is the only real teacher. Jump into it. 
Hello! I teach social media if you'd like to email me - laura@thatbritishchick.com
I'd reccomend you to start with google certificate exams. There is great content for you to study and the exams are free to do! Not only you get certified officially by Google, but you can learn all you need to know at a decent level in Google Analytics and Google Ads. Facebook has a similar program/exam for advertising in the platform (Facebook & Instagram)
Always a bad idea quitting before you find more work, barring unhealthy circumstances. 
How old is the leadership? Sound like they begrudgingly throw money at content marketing because people told them they had to. If they are looking to hire an unpaid intern to supplement your role, they don't value what you do. So what **does** the company value? Generally, revenue, sales, transaction and customer lifetime. Those are stats a leader understands. Start tracking and reporting your successes in how they affect the earnings of the company, how your efforts create user growth that can be tracked to transactions, and how much loyal users can be expected to add to revenue over the next few years with the proper nourishing through your media role. Make it simple and truthful.
Also, working with strategy and helping drive the direction of the company using Analytics could be a boost for you, and you may want to try to take some of that responsibility from the agency. My last gig I earned my stripes by stepping in and calling bullshit on several reporting errors the agency sent us. They weren't lazy but they were completely wrong on several important reports that were driving our decision making. Managers and owners hate looking at  reports that they don't understand, and as an intermediary I became essential (until leaders stopped listening to managers and went belly-up).
My instincts tell me that they won't promote you since they are actively looking for new unpaid interns.
I got my first job at an agency with zero ppc experience through sheer persistence (3 interviews and 2 tests). Just apply and don't take no for an answer.
Not Succeeding is not Failure..True Failure is when close yourself down too early in trying things and work hard..
If you really wanna leave it...Leave it after achieving it.
It’s always better to find a new role whilst you are in a job. Wanting to leave to better yourself is more marketable to new employers.
You know what, forget the old way of thinking "don't quit until you have a job". I have quit several times before having a job, and put 100% of my energy into finding a better fit. As long as you have the savings to do so, and the drive to actually make sh\*t happen (in your case, sounds like that is advancing your education), I would advise you to take that leap!
Talking from experience Do not do MBA in Digital marketing also the coaching institutes who provide certifications are not worth at all. If you really interested in digital marketing then dive in practical go buy domain start blogging or you can start on blogger for free then after some experience you would know what to do."certification won't help" knowledge and experience will certainly do. Goodluck
as someone who has been in this field successfully for over 11 years I'm not even to sure how but digital marketing degree would be relevant. 
I literally have a complete sea change in my business model at least once a year.
Digital marketing is more about problem solving, initiative and persistence.... Yes you need to be somewhat bright and be able to think creatively... The rest of the skills you can learn online mostly for free or find a mentor..... Or if you want to go to the agency route were you just handle people's basic needs without needing to get them results..... You know setting up SEO basic email basic web page then just go for working for a company that does that and learn why you get paid what they are doing..... Hint hint mostly offshoring all that work and closing accounts and keeping on top of their offshore workers....
When you are really good at digital marketing you don't work for somebody else because you have the skill position and all you need is an internet connection and a computer to make money....You don't even need a computer to public library will give you them for free for a week at a time....
As someone who went to grad school before really diving into digital marketing, no it's not worth it at all.  
I'd wait until you reach a point in your career where a masters will help you get the next promotion. That day probably won't ever come, since this is a field judged by results more than credentials.
IMO, on-the-job experience is what's most valuable for you right now. Internships, entry level marketing jobs, etc. Build a portfolio, get some professional references, find out what you like to do, and earn some money.
I would suggest that you do a "techy" masters, data analytics, IT, web dev something like that. 
In my opinion MSc is definitely worth it.
I am just about to start MSc IT as it gives me more insight into related programming. Moreover, I live in a city with 4 large universities and a huge college. There are more than 500 applications for every marketing internship which makes it almost impossible to get and MSc can get you just a little bit farther. 
Anyway, all the people I spoke with who did MSc told me that it is definitely worth it (UK here).
Depends on your desired career path. If your goal is to run a $100m departmentb for a major brand than it would help you achieve that role.
The best and quickest way to get people visiting your site is utilising Google Ads (search or display predominantly) and leveraging keywords/SEO/targeting to display ads to your ideal customers, attracting them to your site (this method is a lot more likely to lead to legitimate customers and grow your user base, ultimately that’s business: gotta spend money to make money).
Since you are already showing up on page 2 or 3 of search results for these keywords, there's a likelihood with some work you could rank higher and get more traffic from them.
It's a lag across the board, because it's waiting for the browser to open and process the request. In my experience linktree doesn't fix the speed issue.
Pm me
Happy to help. Pm me?
I’ve done some consultancy with brands before.
Drop me a line.
Do outreach to get traffic back to you. 
Also do note that traffic is not the same as leads.
You can send cheap traffic with google ads \[display\] but your conversion rates will be abysmal even though your CPC will be 0.01 \[if done right\].
Yes, Facebook has much better-targeting options and an overall less cost per conversion on average. I would recommend using both those because you can hit people from two different areas search/social media and the more you get your ads out the more people will start to recognize and associate your ads to your business. Thus, increasing brand awareness.
For one of my client I used to spend around ₹10,000 and was able to get 10-13 conversions. Due to competition the bidding has increased heavy which lead to high Top Page Bid. So it was simply not sustainable. CPA was around 800-1000. 
So I setup FB ads campaign with ₹5000 for testing phase. I was able to get good traffic and leads. Then I shifted my entire budget to FB and IG. Today with same amount I am able to get 100 leads or more. The quality of traffic of traffic and leads is high and closing rate has seen growth. 
Varies depending on the account. There's never a one size fits all. 
He requires that I jack him off every now and then. >!Because I am the Manager!<.
Jokes apart
That's a great question, it made me pause for some time and look back at everything I've done in digital marketing.
For me personally it would be CRO, conversion rate optimization.
Could be marketing automation as well. I could learn HTML/CSS/Java much earlier too.
3. We don't but PPC hero is a good place to start.
you need Google Ads and Google Analytics - together they do what you want and so much more
do a course and learn it asap
Re: #1, what you're asking for is basically a CRM, ad integration, and e-comm oriented email marketing software all in one.
So buddy keep your work up. All the best.
You can post links on Pinterest which is a big advantage over Instagram. I find traffic time on site is much higher too. I only started using it recently but seems good so far.
For the female demographic and B2C companies, it seems to work quite well. It's a bit time consuming, but can be good if you stick with it and have a strategy in place. Additionally, the advertising is quite cheap still to get your pins seen.
4. And I would suggest you to use Pinterest ... It will help you somehow or either, just it help you to be better and understand this platform too.. Just see to it, that strategy is well enough you to get start. 
You are probably reaching an offline audience or there's no out of the box targeting for your potential customers. 
Are you using very broad US targeting? This works sometimes for B2C and eComm but depending on the software that could be wasting a ton of time/effort. Facebook tries to show relevant ads to people, so if your ads don't seem very relevant, they won't be shown or clicked on. 
Are you getting any other errors from Facebook about the amount of text in your ads? And are you letting them run long enough that the learning phase completes? Consider keeping placements ONLY in Newsfeed everything else is mostly a waste
Is your Facebook Pixel set up? You can try to drive targeted traffic with interest-based targeting and move onto more targeted audiences once your Pixel is fed well.
You have a huge scope of work for your digital marketing - how much of it do you want to hand off? $700K revenue is small enough that little marketing mishaps won't tank your brand, but still large enough that strategy moves can mean the difference in a few hundred thousand $$. 
Standard agency retainers for multi-channel stuff is usually $1k - $5k monthly per channel depending on how much you need (we usually run $1k per channel per month for smaller businesses). Good quality freelance marketers should be around at least $20 -  $40/hour. Much higher for strategy

3 charges
I always use client credit card details for accounts. This means that their cashflow problems are their problem. 
Agree during set up budgeting so they aren't surprised.
I would usually charge around about: 1-2k for setup depending on industry and amount of copy they want written.
Then £300-£600 a month for monitoring.
Budget adjustments are agreed with the client but the management fee remains the same unless extensive extra keyword research is needed.
Always try to charge client with two things in mind.
1. Account and Campaign setup cost (one time)
$500 for account and Campaign setup
Use their ad account for ad spend, tell them to put credit card with $1000 in their ad account
Ask them to bank transfer your retainer, in this case is $500
Create account on quora like websites and create questions and answers with diff account. Use (best) type keywords. Try this and report me
It takes couple of weeks to couple of months. Basically it depends on your SEO efforts. If you do lots of hard work in building the high authority backlinks, then you can rank your keyword within a few weeks. 
Is it indexed? Since ive ranked for the keyword in 2 days all using on page optimization and no backlinks 
Have you tried the Postcards by Designmodo? here are marketing and transactional emails.
\- A/B test subject lines before going out to all
\- pre header text
\- alt text on images
\- CTA above fold for most common clients and 13inch screen
\- CTA above fold for mobile optimised version
\- make sure your data is clean beforehand, dont use a salutation like "Hello AUSSIEJOSH,"
Hey! I made an account to respond to this post. My digital marketing agency has worked with multiple non profits (currently working with veterans transitioning) as well as commercial/government facing brands. We would have no problem executing a politically focused influencer marketing campaign. I'd love to speak more about this, please DM me! 
I've been seeing great results on my personal stuff. Implemented some basic SEO on my videos and got them to reach views in the 5 figures a couple of times. Does this happen every time? No, but you're in a better position to go viral if you do by using YouTube as a different channel to drive traffic to your website!
If you have a limited budget, then you should start building backlinks on high-authority sites. What do I mean by that? Profile links, web 2.0's, social bookmarks, article submissions, etc. 
A job doing grunt work for a mentor.
I run marketing for a pizza catering company and our best marketing efforts have been 1. SEO 2. Google Ads 3. Social retargeting. In that order. 
Step one identify the client's pain points and business goals. 
Two, if required build the client a proper way to track marketing efforts (pixels installed, track conversions into a CRM, ensure the POS allows for taking voucher codes etc). 
Social converts suck.
Foster reviews.
Marketing is mostly about having operational excellence and retention of acquired business. 
Listen to the customers not social chatter. 
It’s 2019 after Fred Algorithm open your wallet for traffic or do it the honest way by being excellent.
Start by building a website and then bringing users onto it and then growing it.
I can give you specific pointers, but honestly, the best way to learn would be to get started, stumble on a problem, find a solution, and then carry on.
I work at a digital agency so I hire people for all kinds of roles all the time and 100% of them are self-taught. 
Where you start sort of depends on what you want to do. If you want to be a developer, start a website. Wordpress is a good place to start -- not too basic but not too challenging either. There are lots of decent free resources for learning to code, like CodeAcademy, etc.
No matter what I'd recommend starting getting into Google Analytics. There's a certificate but I'd probably start with blogs and resources before the cert program.
Start with learning the different verticals of Digital Marketing- email marketing, social media marketing, paid search, and so on.
As "anotherbozo" said, start with a website. The website need not be perfect. Use it to experiment digital marketing tactics.
What company and what certifications do you have? I'm also from the NW Chicago suburbs looking to break into this field
Glassdoor says that the salary range for this posituon in Chicago is $41-$91k with a $61k average.
It's hard to make salary requests without substantial hands-on experience nonetheless I would ask for a 3 month performance review and that should give you leverage depending on your work ethic  and level of commitment. Put yourself in the employers shoes and think of something reasonable. Also remember that they're paying you  to train you whether it's directly or indirectly and those skills will carry over to the next company or your own projects or both.
Either that, or just say you’d like $500k, drop the mic and stare at them until they respond :)
Moz has no control over your website. It's simply a 3rd party tracker that tries to guess, as best as it can, how Google views your site.  
Don't stress. They've (for the most part) just re-optimized so link manipulators don't have as high a score. As a result, DA seems to have dipped somewhat across the board. They go into this in depth on their blog, and cover the average DA dips for different categories of websites. The only way this truly affects anyone is that if they:
No you don't need to take it too serious. But remember that before MOZ 2.0 release, Moz was showing the high DA even of low quality sites. But with MOZ 2.0 it is providing the low DA of low authority sites and high DA of high authority sites.
Feel free to DM me if you have any questions.
What's the website, that would help with feedback. 
We had a client move to GDN from other activity for cheaper clicks but we saw much higher bounce rates from it so its cheap but its not good.
A couple of tips 1) try a whitelisting sites, especially at small budgets get really focused on targeting options which make sense for what you know about your customers. Start super tight, use as many targeting options as you think you could apply, otherwise the system will waste budget on cheap but ineffective clicks. 
2) increase your bids - you get what you pay for and to get some scale when it's tightly targeted. 
have you used mailing lists in the past? 
What is your subject line? 
I also prefer using daily budgets rather than lifetime budgets - makes it easier to scale, should you want to.
Definitely implement the strategy basicbatch suggested, you want to re-target those who showed interest but did not convert initially. 
Intercom does everything you’ve listed and more.  Tidio does a majority of your list for free. Best of luck, this is a tough space.
There are already a few out there.
The concepts are correct but the assumptions on CTR and CR values may not be. It depends on which digital channel we're talking about, the type of campaign, country, etc. For instance 2% CTR is too high if we're thinking only of display banners.
Blogs are great for web traffic increases. We post 2 promoted blogs a week, and see anywhere from 500-1,000 views to our website from these blogs. After they visit our website, they are hit with retargeting ads up to 120 days after the visit of our website. This is to not only stay top of mind, but to gain consistent traffic through people that have shown interest in your service/product previously.
Hope this helps!
I have been following for last 6 months and they work great: twitter.com/CryptologyBook/status/1101566803099049984
Many people argue that backlinks no longer work and do not affect the ranking in the search engines, but I think that this method should also be used but not as it was used before. Back Links should come organically and from trusted sources.
Have you thought about getting into the more technical and analytical side of marketing? I left social media marketing because I felt like it was creeping into my personal life. But I am deciding on going back into marketing but focus on a different side of it
I’m also a digital marketer and thought the same. I have my own personal website so I’m still findable online w/o social media, but I stopped using Facebook about a year ago. I haven’t deleted it per se so I still go on occasionally (maybe once a month) but I’ve removed the app from my phone and found that I’m not missing it at all. 
I’m still using twitter but I’ve cut down on that too, I don’t find myself with more time though, I simply waste it somewhere else... like reddit. 😂
I had the same problem but was not really able to cut down much. I feel the need to stay up to date on how brands are performing (ads and social posts) so I can provide some nice and recent examples to my clients but also have an understanding of “what’s hot” in the market. What did work well was when I stopped working on influencer projects and I could finally unfollow those accounts - THANK GOD!
an example is like i use fb to market and get leads. i do have a fb account but i hardly log on to it to look at my stuff only stuff that will help my business.
Personally, I am a weird person in that I do not care one tiny little bit what other people are doing nor do I care what they think of me. I don't care if someone I know has had a kid, god it's so dull. I don't care if such and such went on a holiday - big deal. I don't care about the time you took your kids to the park.
I don't care about your opinions on current news events - you've all got something so profound to say.
People peddle rubbish about God. People peddle rubbish about vaccines. People peddle SHIT about cryptocurrency like they've found the next big thing - god it's all so fucking pathetic.
It's pathetic to me when I call a company and speak to a young person who simply gives yes or no answers - I die inside as I know this is caused by social media - people don't know how to communicate with others in person or on the phone anymore.
It's like an epidemic of lame. Lame people, lame attitudes. It's all so fucking lame.
Like some others said, try jumping into other areas of marketing. It's one reason I've never fully vested into a social media position. I still help with social media ads, but generally, avoid it. 
It is crazy when you see how much time you waste on these damn social networks and apps. 
Why don't you just create a shopping feed? Bogus that the agency did that. they should have transferred but obviously, they are hiding something. If not shopping campaign go with your first option. More upfront work in the beginning but a little less in the long run and better control and easier to optimize. 
Many advertisers find it helpful to base their ad groups on the sections or categories that appear on their website. 
I'm not so sure what kind of industry you would like to focus on but in my experience (wedding, family, home cooking industries), you should know the quotas of social media posts, kols/influencers, social media groups/forums seeding, online PR articles, website banners, etc... and other things like reach/engagements/impressions (almost everything :) ). It's crazy at the first time but you'll be used to it soon, believe me :)
Figure out who will use this platform early on, and hold them to it - especially if you're paying for seats.
Finally, you want to try to avoid "tribal knowledge" at all cost, so make sure to document any changes you implement on the platform that deviate from how it "should" function out of the box.
*80/20 Marketing*  is also very good for getting the right mindset.  
Would like to know too.
search engine land and search engine watch are good + what the others have listed here. 
I'd start by double checking all of your settings. Make sure you audience is big enough. If your campaign is spending the entire daily budget, it may be that some of your ad groups within that campaign are eating the budget, not leaving enough for other ad groups to serve impressions. If that's the case you can break out the underperforming ad groups into their own campaign and assign a specific budget for them. 
Besides Instagram, Linkedin and Twitter I do see results from, I usually keep it to two hashtags max. I think Twitter still generates the best results for me personally, but I noticed LinkedIn gets me in topics people are following.
A9 is the Amazon’s product ranking algorithm software that displays the results based on the queries or keywords or key terms entered in its search box. The results shown are fueled by customers’ past purchases, shopping preferences, and a few other factors.
Depending on where you are, it only costs like $50 to set up an LLP, maybe a bit more for LLC. Any time you do work for pay you should be doing it under a limited liability company. A lot of people take the risk and don't get it done, and some get sued and lose everything. If you're in a position where you are doing contractual, paid work, you need to be protected by limited liability. It's easy to set up, just look over your state's guidelines.
it will for sure, if you don't have a budget to travel often can always show pictures of your city, towns nearby....it is not all about Maldives and girls in bikini lol
Nobody is going to do that for you. You have to pay some agency (like Branex) to do that for you.
These things needs technical expertise which obviously aren't for free brother.
I hv experience doing PPC for a small company. When I said small, I mean they have a very small budget for your campaign and less likely to give more.
It’s probably more worthwhile to check which ones get used more often in each case. Some phrases/hashtags might work better with plural but others might not. 
Plural or singular is less relevant to whether the hashtag has 10k mentions or 1M. I'd use that as a gauge over a hard and fast rule. 
I was asking the same question too! At least among my colleagues, I found that people find the singular one more intuitive, so go with the singular one -- no s!
At the very least, I'd narrow down a geographic area to start, or at least separate them so you know what's performing best. After that you can drill down more and cast your net on a more relevant and engaged audience (one that you may have already known about or not).
Definitely test both! My agency has seen both broad audiences and very narrow audiences work very well (with regard to ROAS:  return an ad spend).
Adobe Premiere Pro has a lot of advantages and there are lots of tutorials on YouTube. It has all the adjustment features that Photoshop has like shadow/ highlight, colour balance and so forth too. You can resize to fit or have black background. It can be expensive for individuals though so hopefully that app name is just on the tip of someone's tongue for you.
In either case, you need to export the data into a CSV or somewhere else and clean up the data. If you don't clean up the data, doesn't matter what you do as it'll be a mess to work with. Maybe part of the process is working with whoever updates the current sales/stock database or MailChimp to make sure company name, first name fields are entered correctly.
If you’re reviving an old list then expect spam complaints, even if you export the IP and date info and display it in the initial email. 
Fb/display only needs 1000-5000
You can use Excel consolidate and clean up the data. Have columns using formulas to see what info is missing that you need for each customer. Use mail merge to send the email.
The question is what skills did you want to get and in what timeframe? If you are only a couple years outside of school, it can take years to get really good at any one discipline in digital marketing. If your gut says don't go for an agency then don't do it. Maybe you don't want to work in digital marketing. It's not a career for everyone.
Embrace growth. There is no such thing as failure, only feedback. Everyday is an opportunity to learn more, breakthrough barriers and get better. Please don’t allow yourself to be handcuffed by fear of the unknown.
If you want to do it, do it!
I used the general Podcasts interest and then layered on an additional interest that was relevant to my podcast audience. For example, when I was trying to target people who were listening to The $100 MBA and other business school podcasts, I just targeted Podcast and then the Business & Financial interest and it worked amazingly well.
I've definitely come across a similar issue when testing out pages to market against...My suggestion would be to keep testing until you find a page that is available to target since there seems to be no way around the situation for the time being.
I now how have MacBook Pro , on size alone I would recommend it.
I’ve never maxed it out in terms of processing power but I don’t do complex graphic design
I got a 15” last Summer for my senior yr in college. Personally 13” is too small for graphic design. But if you’re on a budget then you gotta do what you gotta do. 
The 13in specs you give dont include discrete gpu so running photoshop on it will be pretty poor experience and forget about video editing.  The 15in will be better if you are using these types of programs although as you probably know to get the same specs as a PC laptop will be around 50% the price of macbook.
Go with 15 inch. You'll want the screen space as you do more creative work. 
13 inch is fine. You can but any HDMI projector. Having a dedicated graphics card for certain programs it's nice but not totally because for the work you'll be doing
There’s a Dynamic Creative option at the Ad Set level that I have found incredibly helpful for testing. With that on, you can upload multiple pics or videos and headlines and figure out which combination works best. I believe it’s only available if the campaign objective is Traffic. Maybe that will help?
I do woodworking as a hobby oh and I'm married so when I get home I can't sit in front of a screen all evening lol 
Actually you should care only about those trends that matter and for that you don't have to read the news 24/7. I would say all you need is 2-3 hours a week. 
To focus on SMO and increase my youtube channel views and subscribers.
It’s not possible to have it removed unless you message the person directly and ask them to remove it. At least that’s been my experience.
Just message them. For all you know it could be a mistake 
I would guess that this company does not know what they are doing. Unless there is some sort of obligation to promote the groupon on your website but I don't think there is!
1. They had people who were sitting on the fence about whether to use their service, this was a way to get them to actually buy something, at low cost.
2. They used Groupon instead of discounting their own fees because , they rarely sold their classes online, most were in 'store', they didn't want to upset their current customers and didn't want to devalue their offerings on their own website and could claim it was just a special promotion. 
I convinced them that 1 and 2 were poor reasoning. Essentially they were giving Groupon a cut for sending them their traffic. 3 is obviously why people try Groupon though (paying for access to the audience). 
Funnily enough 90% of the people who purchase on Groupon don't redeem services (consistently). It was literally free money for their business. Although the offers on Groupon had to fit a specific price point.   
As an aside (and I know this is past your question): after I helped them build an email list of a few thousand people, we began launching promotions to them on Black Friday, Christmas etc. Last year Black Friday was \~$5,000 in sales selling a $49 class. 90% never redeemed as well. Tried again this year at a higher price point and did similar sales. It's quite a particular class they provide, and it's all location restricted. They couldn't believe it was possible to do that amount of sales in just 2-3 days.   
It's part of how they operate. The point of Groupon is not to "get traffic to your site" in fact that's practically irrelevant to the service. The point of groupon is to lock in a large order to boost revenue and business interest.
Groupon sucks ass. Terrible business model that lures people into thinking that they are somehow benefitting by partnering with them, but in reality they are throwing away revenue. I know this from personal experience. It may work in some cases, but my guess is that is very rare
Optimizing your website may help you to increase organic traffic. Here is the few points which is must for product website:
What is the website built on - language and cms platform?
I haven’t used it for this, but I know Screaming Frog will do this. It likely will only handle HTML and JS and won’t be able to scan PDFs or images but it’d get you close. 
I use Siteimprove at work. We have a pretty large site (over 4k pages) and I use it for QA and some of their enhanced analytics tools.
It might work in a slightly different way than what you are thinking though. It crawls the site every few days and you would have to search for the items you are concerned about after. However, it does do images and .pdf files as well as link integrity, spelling, accessibility etc.
Screaming Frog can do that. It's free up to 500 URLs, so if your website is really small that should be enough, if not -year license cost around 150 EUR.
I think - the major reason for this is instagram. All major restaurants moved to instagram and do ads over that medium. However - since facebook still remains biggest medium -  restaurants still maintain a  decent page so that users can check in, give reviews and fb users don't feel alienated. 
Battle has moved to instagram.  
I run ads for bars / restaurants. IG hands-down is the better ad platform for business. I obviously run ads on Facebook as well, but in terms of conversion rate (reservations / calls to book) IG wins. Our demographic is mostly under 40's, so that's probably a big reason.
For some reason I keep getting an error message that says "post cannot be promoted. You may be unable to promote a story for a few reasons, such as: how long ago the story was created, possible rights violations, or the use of certain camera effects." 
It is literally driving me insane because our of the 22 pages I am posting this on it has worked on about 5. It is the SAME video and makes no sense. 
Facebook is a buggy mess when it comes to ads. So many issues 
Hasn't the "all-in" monthly budget already been discussed with the client?
Aside from LA, ATL, and NYC, Florida is rather booming right now, especially south FL. I'm in Northern Florida and it's especially a rapidly growing market.
Boston has a good market lots of high ranking industries too in higher ed (MIT and Harvard are hiring a lot rn) and endless real estate development (working marketing for a developer/pm/architecture side) and pharmaceuticals and biotech are top industries as well. If you seriously want to know more about Boston feel free to message me born and raised did my undergrad here now living/working in the city with no plans on leaving :) good luck!
Metro Detroit.  Low cost of living, above average quality of life
Oklahoma City and the DFW area are huge hot beds. I just moved from Denver to OKC to work for an agency. If you are looking for an internship shoot me a message I have a really good lead for you with a great company.
don't know about campaigns but usually getting on playlists work , get added to different playlists by anyone you can 
some ppl have a large audiences and drop weekly playlists 
Hi guys if you need increase your streams PM me
Influencer marketing is the only thing I can think of off the top of my head that may even stand a chance to work. Would love to hear your thoughts.
Influencer marketing would definitely work. You can also try Social Media Marketing by yourself.
Run vape adwords, social media marketing , affiliate marketing, email campaign on positive effects of vape - make it looks good for society like fighting cancer etc. 
Think how you would woo your customer. Know your customer better. Ideas will automatically come up
Instagram is another good method wherein you can rich targeted audience.
I wouldn’t pay anyone without proven results but some people can bullshit their way into deals. Maybe you’re one of them.
However if you're not then I suggest have proof of you being able to generate leads for them. Show them that its not just you saying "Pay me 2k and I'll give you 10 leads" its you saying "I have these 10 leads, theyre worth 2k as they're of the same quality ive given someone else before and then be able to back it up.
•••You would make even more splitting the sale profit cost. 
Edited to add: Salesloft definitely has local area codes, for $1/phone number/month; don't think Hubspot sales comes with it automatically.
Influcer marketing is differ from platform to platform. I'm aware about influcer marketing in social media. Ask if you have specific questions about them. 
There is a video course on influencer marketing on Linkedin learning.  You can access it free on their free one month trial.
Sometimes you are not doing anything wrong as it can take time to build up the pool of users to remarket. From my experience, video ads don't usually convert our users right away but it does attribute to the conversion down the road. A user might view our 6, 15 and 30-seconds ads. They'll probably see another display ad down the road and eventually visit the site. 
Is the site online?
so you need to scan for tags installed on the website
Not shilling here but I do know HubSpot has a free CRM option and the documentation on why and how is very good. 
The agency i work for specializes in content production. 
Everything on Google academy, everything on Facebook blueprint-- both free. 
Search, social and RTB. 
As the legal cannabis industry is relatively new, all your questions are hard to answer. Probably anybody has worked with this before.
About what's permitted and what isn't. I don't know. You need to research it social media by social media.
Outsourcing is a cheap way to get trivial tasks done. It takes time to find the right people, as others have mentioned, but there are many places to find people to do the work. Don't waste your most valuable, talented resources on trivial tasks.
One caveat is that bad outsourcing will make MORE work for you. We encountered many bad content writers, and I spent more time editing their awful blogs than I did writing them myself. Understand that you won't find the best people right away, but once you do, you will free up a ton of time to focus on the tasks that make you money!
Takes a long time to find that group, but once you do... KEEP THEM BUSY.
Yes!! I'm doing digital marketing still now. Digital marketing is a universal way of marketing and cheaper than traditional marketing. 
I give the highest priority  to digital marketing in the marketing arena.
I believe the stats you’re asking about are linked directly to the post ID - as long as you don’t change the post ID, the stats will remain the same. 
Get in touch with friends and offer to help for free. Even try small businesses.
Then when they like it, 'Cool, the next one costs $100! :)
I'm american so I'm not sure how it works in Canada, but I use Quickbooks Online to accept larger payments. It's free, but it does take a long time (5 business days to receive). I believe Stripe also allows you to accept ACH payments.
I unfortunately don’t know much about working with international clients, but in dealing with my clients here in the US, they always have the option to pay via check. That’s my rationale to put the onus on them to consider that PayPal is for their convenience, not my own.
Hope this helps!
Invest a couple bucks a month into a software that easily creates professional looking invoices which allow your clients to pay with one click. 
A good software saves you time + money plus Stripe has good/low fees and decent (3 days) transfer to bank when clients pay with card. 
I know someone who does this for agencies (sell on commission). Would you like me to put you in touch with them? 
Thanks guy's for the help I didn't get the job but I got some foundation from you guys to improve on :)
Just read about these platforms where 
I can and demonstrate expertise with previous examples. 
I have clients pay their click bill direct to the engine so they can’t decide to stop advertising and stick me with the last month’s bill.
Use Wave accounting. It’s free and has recurring invoices that can auto charge a card every month.
definitely possible, just update the resume and start applying/interviewing. i don't know how feasible $100k is (depends on your area), but if you have tangible experience that you can present, then you should have no problem finding full time work.
Yikes you really call it the addiction industry? 
Difficult to say without knowing more about your target market and how you position yourself, where does your target market come from and how do they discover you?
Perhaps look at specific pages that are have a low conversion rate or high exit rates and try to improve these?
The content does not need to be promotional all the time, it needs to drive attention to it. 
Participate on social media and ask questions to your audience. They possibly will respond and you can put together something. 
Brainstorm themes, then subjects within the themes.  
Yea the person above nailed it, do what he said.
Both.  Find a job. Like was said, experience is the best, but also keep taking courses, and reading.  Digital is a moving target. ABL! (Always Be Learning!)
When they begin to scroll to exit the site/page.
Omni channel > single channel 
Depends on your target market and where they spend time. I’ve found it’s better to do the right channel really well than to half ass all of them. Expand as needs and resources align. 
Some platforms or channels will work for your business and some won't. With that in mind, it's better to get the answer as to what works as fast as possible so you can focus even more on those. Test multiple platforms at the same time, find where your customers are, and scale as soon as the channel is profitable.
Well the biggest reason they are out of fashion is that it’s negative SEO... 
I’ve not used HubSpot personally, but I’d be flabbergasted if they didn’t have a method of importing a suppression list - if you know what the hard bounced email addresses are, just upload them to the suppression file and poof, they’re gone I’d imagine.
count me in for digital marketing!
I'm down I actually studied digital and social media marketing and opened and investment company based around it last month it's in startup grinding by cause I'm a poor kid but I'm hopefully gonna see a 6 figure success soon possibly 
I'm a marketing manager for a tech company. Feel free to reach out! 
Video content, memes and dont spam. Make sure its all relevant to your target audience. Find a niche and test the different types of content they like most. Pictures,blogs, videos or gifs. Test them all out.
You should put a small amount of money behind your posts... Facebook reach for businesses is externally limited.
Set up a portable wifi and have them use their phones. Eliminate the bottlenecks... no wifi and giving people tablets seems like two of your potential bottlenecks. 
I too am working in this sector, and I got a job because I had Google Ads certifications and practical experience in Digital Marketing (I have a website and I gain knowledge by doing various digital marketing experiments on it).
If you have good experience freelancing PPC why would you go back to school? I know people who don’t have a degree but are already making 50 to 70k with 2 year experience. Especially PPC, even I was invited to interview for managerial positions even though I’m not that experienced yet. It’s up to you but I wouldn’t get a digital degree. That’s a waste, I would go to school for a STEM field or law but never marketing.
I did a course in DMI. I had no experience and it landed me a job. The course gives you a good overall understanding of DM and not just PPC. Plus it's a great place to meet potential clients/employers. I didn't do the second year as I was working, some corps do want to see the Masters I suppose, but I haven't needed it yet. 
Typically I get higher engagements and interest from cold traffic to some sort of valuable, interesting content semi-related to the product than a direct BUY MY SHIT NOW!  
Then re-targeting these content readers with sales promotions and offers has a much higher conversion rate
Positive ROI means everything's going great.
Great answers guys
Partnering is not a good idea specially when you are new to a business. I'll only partner with someone when I know everything about a business, or at least 90% about that business!
Hello! I can speak from experience. On 2015 I partnered with a puertorrican lady. We both were internet marketing enthusiasts at the time (when had been studying online marketing for barely a year). 
We decided to create a digital marketing online academy together and what happened is that I ended up doing all the web design, graphic design, studying, translation (because it was I. Spanish) and after 2 years I grew completely fed up of that project because I was producing all the trainings and she was cashing in big on my work. I decided to remove myself from the project and I had to start from scratch again since I don't own the domain name nor the commercial name, it was "her idea".
Long story short, unless you absolutely can't do it on your own with hard work, yeah, partner up. 
I've been creating my personal brand from scratch and getting some contracts as a marketing freelancer and I've been doing well! I didn't need to have partner, entrepreneurship is scary when you're on your own but it will make you grow up.
TL;DR: I created an online marketing academy with a partner and ended up doing most of the work myself and got the hell out of there after two years of being used.
What is PPC, and what do you mean by Branding, like I know what it means but how would it translate to a job (i’m new here).
Once you are an Admin already with that page, you can manage and create ads, no need for client's login details.
Had the same issue. After contacting Google customer service it turned out we had 2 Google tags implemented at the same time (pls don't ask how this could happen and why it's affecting the bounce rate in this way).
Bounce rate is now getting back to normal after deleting one of the tags.
Pm me if you need more help
Common error and almost did it myself last week
automation is going to take over everything - but ... not that fast. 
From my perspective, I am trying to future proof myself and looking to make a shift toward Digital Project Management ...
I have this same question. 
* **Leverage** your existing client base. Always under promise and over achieve.  If you do that, your clients will be extremely happy. Hopefully. If they are, don't hesitate to ask them to bring in new clients. They probably know someone who could benefit from your skills too. And if they can help their network, they're even happier.
I suck at marketing and need a professional but the ones I found charge hundreds up setup and manage.
Books - The Mom Test and When Coffee met kale. After reading and practicing what these books say, I am able to understand whether something is a real need or not wayyy better than I could earlier.
What I used in my digital marketing education is HubSpot, Udemy, and Coursera.
HubSpot and the Google AdWords/Analytics is good. But remember, certifications don't mean much without actual experience too. Start a blog and write content about marketing initiatives and insights, showcase what ya know and experiments you might have run for others. 
OMCP was great. $1,500. Learned it all. Started a business.
1. It's a little too busy for my taste but I'm a web developer so I tend to hate overdone websites. It just seems like you selected all the bells & whistles (everything flying-in etc). The header folding is a little annoying, just do the simple slide up.
2. You need some padding on the pricing table. There's also so much going on there too it makes me not want to read. Clean up the padding, maybe add bullets or checkpoints,  etc.
3. There's gray text on contact form that doesn't do well with contrasting.
Hello! Great work on the website. Not much of an expert with that but in terms of ease of use / navigation, I had no problem with it.
About acquiring clients, you can look into eCommerce business owners. They are everywhere and most of them don’t know how to market their online stores. But, of course, they need a guarantee that you will be able to drive traffic and convert that into sales. So you also have to manage their expectations when it comes to ad budget. If they only give you $100 for ads monthly, I’d rather not accept it. 
Your website is a parallex website but not optimise according to Google Guildlines. 
How is the flat monthly rating working out for you? What if they need a larger change that's taking more of your time?
I have reviewed your website and got to result that the **web designing** part is commendable and the proper padding and its designing part is good enough. As a Qdexi Technology's Senior web developer i reviewed it and your website seems interactive to me and I must take some help related to features that your website have. The theme used is good and the development wise it is also of a good quality.
Check the countries the ad is showing in?
Can you export the data from ads manager and check what number it is showing there? 
*My answer doesn't have any evidence or experience to back it up. 
First I'd ask myself, what's the end goal in obtaining a master's degree? 
 2. Get hired for excutive/management position at companies in unrelated industry.
2. Get hired for management position at a digital agency. 
3. A position at a digital marketing tech company. 
I wouldn’t do a masters in digital marketing. I wouldn’t do a bachelors in digital marketing.
If you take a Masters of Digital Marketing, you might learn how to do digital marketing a bit better.
>     We are having troubles getting full access to these pages in order to bring them into the Ads Manager.
Can you elaborate? If they're holding the page and not giving access back to the rightful owner, you could ask Facebook to relinquish their control of the page. 
The real difficulty is the traffic generation not the site creation....trust me on this, I built a company that did this a few years back.
Not trying to be negative, but doing exactly what other traditional, full-service agencies do isn't exactly "unique"  0 that said, it's not a bad idea...and can totally work if you've got the networking/marketing chops to find clients. 
it's helped me and I didn't major in marketing or have any experience in marketing.
Is it just negative, neutral, positive sentiment outputs?  Can we extract deeper meaning around words, language and trend topics?  
* Why not utilise the new IGTV for masterclasses with the kitchen staff?
* POST ALOT OF EYECATCHING CONTENT SHOWING OFF YOUR FOOD USING A MINIMUM OF 15 RELEVANT HASHTAGS. None of the above strategies work without content on your page already
If you want increase your Instagram followers so you have to focus on Instagram   you have to send daily update picture  of your restaurant   i have also five restaurant but when i started few people know about my restaurant but after few days  one of my friend suggested me to connect restaurant business with social media  i do and  i didn't get  very much response but now i  using instalex pro  and which is really help full for me  getting followers likes  on my all social media account.
Don't forget you need sales, not followers. Instagram is a tool you're using to get sales for lunch. Make sure they don't just think you have a cool IG page!
Do you know Gary Vaynerchuk ? And his instagram strategy ? It will take few hours to achieve that but worth to try it :) 
i've had many, and i tend to favor dreamhost. i've been with them for about 6 years now and set all my my clients up on them as well. never had an issue, no downtime, excellent customer service, seemless dashboard design.
I would recommend FleHost. I've been with them since the start of the year and so far it has been an outstanding experience.
I honestly don't mind GoDaddy. They've never given me any reason to be mad at them. Incredible support and you offload costs if they are client sites.
1 and 1 has always been really good for me 
Is the meaning the same as it is here in England? Rep management assumes you've fucked up something and need to hide it.
It's very hard to increase the limit if you reach out to FB, sometime it takes weeks for them to respond. Usually the threshold is about $35 Ad spend before more open up. But don't quote me on that, it may be the majority but sometimes it takes more spend. It took me about $150 to open 2 more than $300 for another 2.
This is a recently added security feature to avoid inauthentic advertisers. Normally you have to have a certain amount of spend in an account to prove it isn’t fraudulent, but if you reach out to Facebook support chat they should be able to help you increase the limit.
2. Use filters to screen. For upwork, I'd screen out agencies, target us only, 90% or better, and use upwork test scores to filter your results. I like to stay in top 20%. Pick 2-3 and have detailed interviews about the project.
There are nightmare clients too.
I m not sure why you have such a bad idea about upwork. I work in a similar website, set up my profile 1 year ago and made 40k until now, only from Google adwords gigs. I have had many hundreds of happy clients . I am sure that there are many more skilled people on upwork or similar websites. I believe that, if you check their reviews, you will find a person who know what's up and can help you achieve your goals
I run a company that offers PPC services but I don't want to be too self promoting.  I'd avoid Upwork and find a local agency. If you pay budget prices you'll get budget results.  
yes, a basic working understanding would also help - have you worked on accounts before?
Also check out the business pages of the social media platforms you're looking for. LinkedIn I know has one: https://blog.linkedin.com. The others do as well.
Hope that helps!
i was an affiliate marketer than i moved it to the next level so i started professionally in a company. 
- Create a wordpress for you about what you love, just try to find low comp. niche.
- Make some videos about your niche, upload them to top 3 - 4 video sites so you will learn how to drive traffic with videos.
Thats awesome! Congrats! I would come in prepared with a sample strategy that would make them better, I have been in your shoes, and the one thing that has helped me has been showing their need and that I had a solution. Just one "Main" need in SEO or Paid search is enough to get you hired. I did this at one of my jobs and they wanted me to start the next day...lol
Be sure to not use it as your only acquisition channel. Install the FB Pixel code on your website and start tracking conversion.
IMHO, chatbots can be really useful, if created correctly. But if it's a boring bot, I don't think it brings much help to the company. Just like a bad salesperson - he/she is out there to represent you. So if the person (or chatbot) who represents you is just there for appearances and isn't creative one bit... well, I don't think there's any point in using it. 
It's way more complicated, unfortunately. You've probably seen on google (who owns YouTube) that it's very context aware. For example, searching "cheap cars" is recognised as a non-branded search so even perfectly matching keywords (like a company called "cheap cars") doesn't do much if anything. It's also something that will favour local results. YouTube also considers the context in similar ways like news topics favouring recent videos and evergreen topics caring less. YouTube's raking is mainly built on machine learning so not even they know how it functions. YouTube programmers tell it what to optimise for and the best-generated models are used. Same with Netflix, Amazon and most major platforms. As for what it optimises for, YouTube has been open about deemphasising the role of views for most of a decade (as it leads to more clickbait and people gaming the system). Watch time and watch sessions (there are YouTube help pages on them as it's quite technical) has been the focus and engagement (likes, subs, comments etc.) have been hinted at recently. 
Ive done it. Many other have done it too. It works, its simple. The hard part is finding such subject and doing a decent video that wont lose in ranks later on.
There are many layers to YouTube Algorithm.
You van get many many views from suggested video and the home page. I work with SEO here in Brazil and the way YouTube works nowadays changed a lot. Really really new channels have a hard time being promoted, but it happens. Growing channels get more and more views from suggested and home. Fact.
YouTube apparently has to understand who consumes your content and the quality of it. A good suggestion is making more than 50% of your viewers watch until the very end of your video.
Yeah its no easy. Ita easier for very niche channels and channels that create highly shareable content.
If it’s a niche thing, what you’re saying will probably work. 
Like others have said and you stated in step 1, find a lucrative niche you can exploit in terms of opportunities and low competition. At the end of the day, it's all about getting views.  
Well, I know how feel. My education was in the medicine and after my degree I realized that I don’t want to practice at all. 
After putting so much thought into what to do, I decided to go into digital marketing field. When I stated my agency back in 2016 September, I didn’t know anything about Digital Marketing except Social media management but today O am glad that I really made that decision.
Yes it was very tough and a nightmare at times but I kept Learning and kept going. Now I am better at learning and earning from those people who had an IT or Marketing background. It doesn’t matter where you are, don’t wait for the right time. The time is never gonna be right, just start doing.
If you won’t quit despite of adversities, I can guarantee that you are going to make it as a business owner.
My previous job had specialist in the title and it was more about the income level than the actual work. Instead of down talking the job figure out how to talk it up for when you interview for your next position. 
You just have to spin it the right way. 
Just make sure to have a decent personal website, and it’ll help if you get Google Analytics certified.
Well, Free online courses will guide you through everything from search engines, to social media and beyond. 
For real estate automated marketing, we use MavSocial. It has worked wonders for us (as compared to Hootsuite & Buffer). We absolutely love the "Social Inbox" feature which lets us respond to comments and DM's right inside the MavSocial software, no need to login to our 20+ social media accounts.
It is a set it and forget it system that executes your social strategy forever.
•Experiment with Instagram stories. Go into the factories and show the process of how it’s made. 
•try social media giveaways and contests
•try to advertise in fancy product magazines (golf, cigars, etc) 
I'm not sure I understand your premise. Do you think none of the major or even minor movie studios or the theater chains do digital marketing? They all do, very, very well. 
Social media can drive a lot of traffic to movie
•	An interactive Facebook page dedicated to the movie
•	Use all popular social media channels – Instagram, Pinterest, etc. 
•	Social competitions & quizzes
You're basically contracting a marketing company, no? 
You could try a paid video ad on YouTube  (you only pay if someone watches more then 15 seconds eg. Does not skip). You should add a cta like "Help the artist by sharing". 
Maybe also showing the face of the artist at the end or  letting the artist talk about his work.
This could help you stand up from all the other faceless channels.
I'm a software engineer working day to day with adops and other DM positions. I wouldn't want to sound pretentious, but I feel that computer science is much more deep and complicated than data marketing. The knowledge required upfront for both jobs seems entirely different to me. Both are very exciting jobs thought - most of my adops colleagues work 10h a day partly because they just like their job. Feel free to ask me any question, I'll try to answer my best.
If you want to start your own business in digital marketing you will have to be a people person in order to land clients. Can you take free courses and land a job where you develop more skills... probably. These are two very different career paths wherein think knowledge in both would be a benefit but you would likely be an expert in one. You just have to decide where your talents are better suited. 
Define a plan (learning path) for her. Find out what she knows already (that's her starting point) and then figure out what can she learn in that limited amount of time (where do you want to get her to). In-between there are many milestones which you can turn into challenges that she needs to figure out. Let her do most of the learning herself and be around just at certain times (for example 1 hour a day to see how she's doing). Follow this old saying: "give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime"
2. The same Director lets me do the data analysis to leverage our marketing decisions. 
3. I was given the opportunity to make creative purchasing decisions. (Purchased Adobe Creative Cloud License)
3. Help them set up the computer and email stuff. Interns don't often know a lot about this. I had to help other interns find the email button...
Thirdly, start your experience bullets with power words. Like, "Efficiently managed daily operations... ", "Expertly devised a strategy for..." This leaves a better impact.
If you want me to craft your professional resume, you can DM me. I have some creative templates to show as well.
I think that's not a bad list. It's good. You could land an entry-level position with that list after some editing. For example, instead of saying used SEO, elaborate if it was onsite SEO, Offsite SEO, Local SEO or an aspect of SEO like inbound marketing. Same thing with saying you're experienced with Adwords. Elaborate on how you're experienced in Adwords PPC. Did you utilize bid adjustments after spotting trends in your account? Did you work to improve your quality score or improved your negative keyword lists to decrease cost per conversion that led to an increase in ROI? So elaborate with a few more details in how you're exactly experienced in those different aspects of digital marketing. 
As far as certifications go, you should get Adwords certified (Most Important), Analytics, Bing Ads. and Hubspot Inbound Marketing. All those certifications are free and do not take long to get. You'll need to get Adwords certified even if you get the job anyway if it's an agency. As a friend said, "A Google Adwords certification and a can do attitude will get you further ahead than any digital marketing diploma."
I have been hiring Digital Marketing professionals since 2 years now. Let me tell you nobody is bothered by the enormous amount of functional skills that you have mentioned.
Highlight your achievements. Supplement your skills with achievements instead of boring functions. If you know Google Analytics - what did you do with it ? What have been your achievements? 
You know something along those lines. Hope this helps!
