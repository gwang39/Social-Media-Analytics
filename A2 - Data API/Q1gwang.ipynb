From my experience from being balls deep in the job search after university, I would say there is a lot of demand for data scientists but unfortunately, the vast majority of listings I saw usually required already having some (usually 3+ years) experience as a data scientist/quant. So the demand is there but the hard part I believe is getting your foot through the door. \n",

Most starting salaries I've seen for entry level data scientist roles are similar to that for an actuarial role, but if you want something that's more programming focussed, I'd be more inclined to go down the data science route over the actuarial one. I've seen some data science Jobs requiring 5+ years experience offering £100k+, so the earnings potential is certainly there. I've recently read that your long term earnings potential in the field also depends on other factors such as your ability to manage a team and do more client facing work, which may vary from company to company but is also worth noting. \n",

      "If you do end up switching models, I'd look into FB's [prophet](https://research.fb.com/prophet-forecasting-at-scale/) model or anything forecast based over ML based purely so that you can take the seasonality into account - most businesses are going to have months that perform differently to others with some regularity. You could also look into Hyndman's Forecasting Principles & Practice if this is something you do regularly as he has a lot of good start points and did the forecast library in R. \n",
      "\n",
      "But without a great deal of information about why the model isn't performing well, it's difficult to know if it's performing badly because it's not well suited to the problem - maybe they don't have a great deal of seasonality and my comments about forecasting are way off. I've done an end of day model revenue forecaster using xgboost in the past that mostly took lagged factors into account - adding expected conversion rates for previous days & weeks helped considerably, as did adding in combination effects by testing the multiplication & addition of numeric fields, as a decision tree is unable to consider multiple columns at once otherwise. \n",

      "Body:  I was in a similar situation about two to three years ago. I took the path of learning SAS (a fairly common statistical analysis tool). The added benefit is that SAS supports SQL, albeit with a few minor differences in syntax. I also took a Database Management course at my local Community College to establish a foundational understanding of how databases work. The course leaned exclusively on SQL as the query language. I also took some formalized SAS training through the SAS company. I've done quite a bit of self study and am working my way through Data Science for Business. I've heard a lot of great things about this book and I'm about half-way done with it. It seems to be a great introduction to the many concepts within Data Science. It's not overly technical but it should give you an idea of where you might have an interest in focusing. I also took a Java course to boost my understanding of object-oriented programming. I am self-taught on VBA/Excel which was my introduction to programming and how I stepped away from Excel by leveraging macros to get into programming. I wouldn't necessarily recommend VBA unless you have plans to remain at a company that relies heavily on Excel without access to many other data analysis tools.\n",

However, keep your eye on the future and what languages/tools businesses will be looking for, e.g. Python.\n",
